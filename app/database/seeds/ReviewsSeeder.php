Before I begin, a little bit of history about Dark Souls and myself. I picked up the original Dark Souls around my birthday either the year it came out or the year afterwards (I forget what its exact release date was) because I had heard good things about it, despite its difficulty. That night I played it for maybe an hour and gave up. I simply couldn't get into it the first time I tried it. Fast forward about a year or two. My family has moved to San Antonio, it is summertime, and I'll be living away from home (and by extension, my consoles) for the first time in about a month's time. At the time, I decided I needed something to really sink my teeth into in order to make the last month of consistent gaming time memorable. With that in mind, I picked up Dark Souls again, started a new game, and gave it another shot. This time, I ended up sinking somewhere around 55 hours into it and truly loving it not just for its revolutionary gameplay but for its rich narrative world as well. Then I got my younger brother into it, and he proceeded to surpass me in time spent and adoration of the game. The original Dark Souls and I, needless to say, were a match made in heaven. Then a few more years passed and Dark Souls II came out, and opinions were pretty split on it. Though it was definitely not as strong as the original in terms of its narrative, I adored Dark Souls II for its much improved sense of progression and the additional polish that it brought to the series' already stellar gameplay. Did it have some flaws that the original didn't have? Absolutely. However, despite some criticisms, I really did love Dark Souls II, and it would have won Game of the Year from me that year were it not for Dragon Age: Inquisition. Then 2015 came, I got a PS4, and From Software (the company behind Dark Souls) came out with a new game, \"Bloodborne.\" It was the very first game I got for the PS4, and I was not impressed. I was so not impressed that I never finished it. It replaced the methodical, deliberate gameplay of the Souls games with a juvenile hack-and-slash-button-mash anime fight-fest, and it replaced the subtle creepy atmosphere of the Souls games with a gushing-blood gushing-gore deformed monster kind of atmosphere that could only appear edgy to a kid in the early 2000's with spiky yellow hair and a black button-up shirt with little flames on the bottom. However, critics loved Bloodborne, which did not bode well for whatever From Software was going to release next. Then I learned that the next project was going to be Dark Souls III, and a part of me was afraid. Then, gameplay teasers and small details started to be released for Dark Souls III and I started to be more optimistic about it.
Thankfully, this is one instance where my optimism turned out to be well-founded. Dark Souls III is not a perfect game, but it is a spectacular one. Where it takes inspiration from Bloodborne is obvious, but it doesn't replace anything in the Souls formula. Rather, the things it takes from Bloodborne serves to enhance the Souls formula. I am already nearing the bottom of the first page of this review, and I haven't even really started it, so that should tell you that I have many thoughts on Dark Souls III. Like I said, this will be absolutely spoiler-free, but it will be very in-depth in terms of the quality of the mechanics and the like. So, you may feel free to read on without fear if you haven't played through Dark Souls III, but if you're the kind of person who feels that a game has been spoiled for you if you know about gameplay mechanics and the game's quality before playing it for yourself, then turn back right now, because we're about to open up this game and delve deep into it. Let's get started.

Dark Souls III, like past Dark Souls games, opens up with an eerie prologue. This prologue was used as a trailer, but I still won't say anything about it. Then, it takes you to character creation, where you can expect to be faced with the same kinds of choices you've made in past Souls games. Where does my character hail from? What kind of build are they? What kind of starting item do I want them to have? I went into Dark Souls III as a sellsword named Palemar (and I spent a lot of time helping people out with boss fights, so if that name seems familiar to you, there is a chance we may have fought together at one point or another). One thing that I noticed in the character creation for Dark Souls III was that it was much easier to role play this time around. By that, I mean that character origins seem to be much more descriptive this time around, so when selecting a place of origin you take into account not just the appearance, but what kind of person your character might be having hailed from this location. Maybe that was an aspect of previous Souls games, but I never noticed it in the past.
From there, you are in the tutorial section. As usual, you can expect to get a basic grasp of the way things work and to then be thrust into the world mercilessly.

In order to properly examine the world of Dark Souls III, we must first determine what the role of a game is in terms of its world building. Unless a sequel is not connected to the original by any stretch of the imagination, no sequel will ever be as good as the original in terms of its world building. That is just a fact. Why? Because the original game is the only game that actually has the burden of setting up the world, and thus it tries its hardest to excel at it. With that in mind, the question we must ask of sequels, and the standard we must hold them to deals with how well they inform the established world. What new information does this installment bring to the table? What do we learn through this story that we couldn't possibly have learned in the original? That is one of the ways in which I felt that Dark Souls II was lacking. That is primarily because, despite Dark Souls II being connected to the original, it felt otherwise. This is one area in which Dark Souls III excels. It doesn't directly connect to the story of the original, but within the first few hours we learn truths that we couldn't possibly have known about not just Dark Souls, but Dark Souls II as well. In this regard, Dark Souls III performs its function as a sequel flawlessly. In fact, I would go so far as to say that it goes beyond the call of duty here. If you love the richness of the Dark Souls lore, then rejoice, because Dark Souls III enriches the lore that exists while also adding some of its own. If you are paying attention throughout the game, there will be times where you will realize that something in one of the previous games was not as it originally seemed. This happens a number of times, so be prepared to have your world shaken.
Part of why Dark Souls III's world building is vastly improved over Dark Souls II is because of its focus. The original Dark Souls was all about a world's final pained whimper as it slowly died, and you were just a little bitty pawn in the events. Dark Souls II, on the other hand, was about you and your place in the world, which added to the subpar nature of the world building. In Dark Souls III, there isn't so much a happy medium as there is a happy 10/90. There is some degree of focus on you, as characters seem to flock to you as you start doing what they never could, but for the most part the focus is back on the world and its dying nature. This time around, however, the sense isn't so much that the world has been dying for a long time and this is its last cry for help. Rather, this time around it feels like the world has only just begun to die and that the initial blow to the world was catastrophic, and it really works. There is beauty to be found in this world still, but it has started to crumble now that the world has begun to die. This message can be found through the level design. Castles and fortresses stand tall still, but certain aspects of them will imply a state of decay, such as flags being ripped to shreds and courtyards being filled with corpses. It isn't the same kind of bleak world as the original Dark Souls, but this world and its characters are no less effective.

At time of writing, I have beaten the game as well as new game + and I am about halfway through new game ++. 2 and a half play throughs, every boss beaten, every area discovered, and I am still yet to discover all there is to discover about the characters in Dark Souls III. As in previous Souls games, you can expect completely vague ways in which to advance a character's story. And as in previous Souls games, you can look up the steps on the wiki without feeling any shame, because that is the only way you're going to manage it.
Dark Souls III manages to do something that Dark Souls hasn't managed to do since Solaire of Astora in the original: make us feel attachment to characters. I won't say which characters I felt I connected with, but rest assured that they exist. As in the original Dark Souls, the character stories take up the span of the whole game, so they last as long as you make them. Also as in the original Dark Souls, there is a certain degree of unpredictability to the character stories. There are times where you'll stop and say to yourself \"Do I really want to advance this character's story? I want to get to know them more...but after Solaire...\". I, of course, won't say whether or not you should advance character x's storyline, but I will say that you would be correct to fear doing so. Whether or not that fear is unfounded, well, that is up to you to find out.
One negative thing that I will say about the characters of Dark Souls III is that there are not nearly enough merchants, and there wasn\'t nearly enough variety in the wares they sold. That is a very small problem, but it is a problem nonetheless. I felt that Dark Souls III was stingier with its items as a result. I survived just fine, but I really would have liked some more options for bartering than what we were given.

With this talk of merchants, we are now beginning to get into the gameplay. The first thing I'd like to talk about in terms of gameplay is an aspect that has a negative point inside of it, so we can get that out of the way. The first thing I'll talk about in terms of gameplay is blacksmithing. Both previous Dark Souls games had blacksmith characters who would improve your weapons and armor if you had the resources. Dark Souls III has much the same deal going on, except this time From Software has included weapon infusions. Souls players have always been able to make fire or lightning weapons, but now there are plenty more options. I can't say that I really used many of them, but I did really appreciate the amount of options given for weapon infusions because it in part made up for the fact that you can't upgrade armor in Dark Souls III. I felt that taking out the ability to upgrade armor was a misstep on From Software's part. The thing about weapon upgrading is that it allowed you to make a weapon that you like better than other weapons. For example, in the original Dark Souls I made it through about half the game with the reinforced club I got towards the beginning of the game. I knew how the reinforced club worked and I didn't want to give it up, so I upgraded it obsessively. Before long my reinforced club was better than some legendary greatswords I was finding. That is a major facet of Dark Souls: taking equipment that you like and really making it special, really making it your own. By taking out armor upgrading in Dark Souls III, From Software made it so that you constantly have to make a choice: keep using the armor you like, or use better armor. It was a minor annoyance because armor didn't really mean that much to me, but I did miss having the opportunity to make my armor my own.

Now lets talk about level design and the like. The world is largely interconnected. It isn't quite as interconnected as the original Dark Souls, but you can get just about anywhere on foot if you so desire without having to travel through the bonfires. At its worst, the level design in Dark Souls III is familiar, and at its best, it is absolutely stunning. Even when it is familiar, however, Dark Souls III uses the familiar aesthetic to accomplish new things. I can't give an example to prove my point here, but if you play it and pay close enough attention when you feel like you've played through a similar area in a previous Souls, you'll see what I mean.
In terms of graphics, Dark Souls III is obviously not up to part with other triple-A releases, but when have Souls games ever been known for their graphics? Despite the slightly average graphics, however, Dark Souls III makes the best of it. There are moments where your jaw will draw because of how well the game utilizes its scenery. Dark Souls III is also locked at around 30 or 32 fps with a few framerate dips when the action gets really intense. It is never quite Blighttown-level bad, but you will notice when the framerate dips. All of these things may seem like negatives, and a dipping framerate is in fact a negative, but Dark Souls II takes what it has and makes it work, which is worthy of commendation.
One thing that I noticed in Dark Souls III that definitely has not been the case in previous games is the fact that nowhere is pointless. No matter which direction you walk in, if you keep going far enough and survive long enough you'll find some new secret area or optional boss fight or item. You may even stumble upon one of the many new covenants that Dark Souls III boasts (*flawless segway*).

Covenants have been a facet of Dark Souls since its genesis. In Dark Souls, each covenant offered you certain benefits if you completed your objectives and certain punishments if you betrayed them. In Dark Souls II, covenants were given more purpose and were generally improved, in my opinion. Dark Souls III definitely takes after II in this regard.
From Software, however, made one decision with covenants in Dark Souls III that isn't necessarily a negative, but I just find it a tad odd. In previous Souls games, joining a covenant was given some kind of weight, like you were swearing a solemn oath (thus the punishments for betrayal). That is why I find it questionable that you can now switch between covenants willy-nilly. A covenant is now an equippable item, and once you equip it you have joined the covenant. You can switch between them at will and reap the rewards for all of them simultaneously even while not sworn to them. Plus, there are no punishments for switching away from a covenant. This wasn't a problem for me because I only really wanted to be part of one covenant, but I still think that you ought to know about that going in.
One positive thing about Dark Souls III's new covenants, though, is that there is much greater potential for roleplaying. Certain covenants will change what color your phantom appears as in both pvp and in co-op or will change what your label is when you invade a world or enter a world for co-op. It was a nice little feature that made being part of a covenant feel more personal.
There are more covenants than ever now, and they all deal with multiplayer. Normally I would say that with a groan, but the multiplayer in Dark Souls has historically been quite good, and I take every chance I can get to play it.
Like in previous Souls games, multiplayer takes form in either Player vs Player or Co-op. You use a red eye orb to invade another player's world and try to kill them for their souls, or you leave your summon sign at a boss area and let yourself be a sellsword for someone in need. It has always been a strong system, and it is just as strong here. With the added covenant roleplay, it is even more fun to do.

You don't have to be online to have fun with Dark Souls III, however. Gameplay is what you are used it, but it has an even larger amount of polish on it in addition to the polish from Dark Souls II. Timing is everything in Dark Souls. When looking for a weapon, damage is not the factor to look for. You should try to find a weapon that has the kind of timing you want, because that will determine whether or not you survive. You could beat Dark Souls III or any Dark Souls game for that matter with a tiny little dagger if you knew how to use the timing.
The major new addition to gameplay is the \"battle art.\" My impression of those is a resounding \"meh.\" They don't take anything away from the experience, but I just never used them because, as I've said, timing is everything, and the battle arts just messed up my formulas. Essentially, every weapon has a battle art, a special ability. With some weapons, the battle art is an increase in poise or attack, with some it is a special flipping acrobatic attack. Some folks really like them, others are like me and just stick with what they know. You can be the judge of that for yourself, but in my opinion they are just kind of there. I won't be taking off any points for them, but I did think they were kind of an unnecessary attempt to please Bloodborne fans. Granted, it is an attempt to appease Bloodborne fans in a way that doesn't interfere with the traditional gameplay formula, so I am grateful for that.
Like in previous Souls games, you'll mainly be fighting enemies of three categories: Hollows, dudes in armor, and monsters. There is always variety within those categories, but that is pretty much the gist of it. Unfortunately, I found that there was less enemy variety in Dark Souls III than there has been in previous Souls games. Too often, Dark Souls III brought stronger variants of previous enemies for later segments,  and while it is a small complaint, it was something that detracted from my experience a bit.

When you aren't fighting regular enemies, you are fighting Bosses, which have long been a staple of Souls games. The boss design in Dark Souls was quite good and quite varied. The boss design in Dark Souls II was less so, but still decent, and in Dark Souls III bosses are once again varied and creative. Unlike in previous games, there weren't any bosses that I felt were just there to be filler. It felt as if every boss you encounter in Dark Souls III has a role to play in the narrative world, so every time you go up against a boss you are going up against a piece of the game's history. However, there is one non-optional boss in this game that is quite underwhelming. I won't say which one it is, but you enter the room and it would appear to be pretty frightening, but the entire boss fight feels like a deflating balloon. This boss fight will be what takes the most off of the final score.
It is in the bosses that one can see some more inspiration from Bloodborne, albeit inspiration from Bloodborne that has been tuned down. In Bloodborne, bosses would often shift forms halfway through or suddenly have a whole new health bar out of nowhere, and this same kind of adaptability can be found in some of the bosses in Dark Souls III, but not quite to the same extent. In Dark Souls III, given that most bosses have history to them and some kind of intelligence, when they shift forms, gain new attacks, etc. it feels like they are doing so out of some last ditch desperate effort to survive, and it is a welcome change that makes the game more challenging without being cheap.
On that note, critics and fans alike have unfairly marketed the Souls franchise as \"really really hard.\" Indeed, hard has been the marketing for Souls games since Demons Souls, and it sends the wrong message. The Souls games are difficult, but the real purpose of the difficulty is to force the player to better acquaint themselves with the game mechanics and become better players before proceeding. Souls games have never been hard for the sake of being hard. Still, everyone (myself included) wanted to know where Dark Souls III would fall on the difficulty spectrum.
My answer to that question, having played through it two and a half times with increasing difficulty, is that it is between Dark Souls and Dark Souls II leaning heavily towards Dark Souls. It has the same fantastic sense of progression that Dark Souls II had without being quite as easy as II was (for those who are going to argue that II wasn't easy, I beat the final boss in somewhere around 3 seconds. It was an easy game). It never quite reaches banging your head on a brick wall level of frustration but you will definitely clench the controller tightly and exhale through your front teeth a few times.
But as frustrating as some bosses may be, you at least can take comfort in knowing that you can hear the soundtrack piece again. Dark Souls III's soundtrack may be lacking some of the dissonant tension of previous soundtracks, but it does sport the greatest of the three soundtracks. There is so much more emotion used in the soundtrack to Dark Souls III, and I can't name any specific examples for fear of spoiling, but there are very intentional musical cues that tell stories of their own within the soundtrack. I just find the way that Dark Souls III uses music as a storytelling mechanic to be fascinating.

Here we are. The end of the road. Dark Souls III is reportedly the final installment in the Dark Souls series, so who knows where From Software is going to go next...hopefully not Bloodborne II. But let us summarize what we've learned about Dark Souls III. It has solid gameplay as we've come to expect, solid boss design, depth of world building I haven't seen since the original Dark Souls, worthwhile, unpredictable character stories, enough intrigue in its level design to encourage exploration, as deep a story as we are used to, and some worthwhile tweaks to bosses. All in all, Dark Souls III is not a perfect game, but it is fantastic.
Starting with this review, I'm going to be trying something. Before giving my final score, I'm going to be re-stating the negatives that actually made an impact and assigning an amount to them based off of how much they detracted from my experience with a \"1\" being something that completely changed my feelings about the game. Then I will be taking the total away from 10 to get the final score. So, lets do that with Dark Souls III. The negatives were:
-No armor upgrades: 0.2
-Lack of enemy variety: 0.2
-The underwhelming boss fight: 0.5
So my final score for Dark Souls III is a resounding:


9.1/10

	$review2->slug = "thatdragoncancer";
	$review2->body = "Lately, my reviews have been pretty vague, and there is a reason for that. Most of the games I've been playing lately are best experienced knowing as little as possible. Nowhere is that statement more true than in this one. This will be the shortest and least detailed review I have ever written, and I intend only to say what needs to be said in order to give you an idea of if you want to spend the $15 that this game requires. So, lets just get right into it.

The game I'm reviewing today is called \"That Dragon, Cancer.\" Production on it started in 2012, and it was funded through kickstarter for the last few years. It finally came out about a week ago, and it came out on the OUYA slightly earlier, but the point is that it is a very recent game that has had a pretty long,  pretty famous development period. It is a point and click game that is more focused on its narration and its story, and in the interest of preserving that story, I won't say any more than the steam description does. The story follows a little boy name Joel Green in his struggle against cancer. It takes us through his family's conflicts of faith and the like as well. That is all that I'm going to say in terms of giving you the set up...but there is something else that I need to say on it before I move on.

You are not prepared. Nothing that I say here, nor anything that anybody else tells you about the plot of this game can prepare you for how devastating this game's story is. I am not the kind of person who cries easily. If entertainment of any kind wants me to shed a tear, then it really has to work for it. That Dragon, Cancer is approximately two hours long, and I was absolutely bawling my eyes out for about 95% of the time. That means that those of you who cry really easily in movies or those who have history with the subject matter can expect to be in really bad shape throughout this game. This is not a fun game. It is not a game that is enjoyable to experience, but it is an incredibly important game that gives a great deal of perspective on the topic. It is my opinion that everybody ought to play or at least watch somebody play this game at least once. However, if you are a parent or maybe somebody who has a history with cancer (whether you had it or somebody you loved had it), then you may want to sit this one out. Because, as devastating as this game was to me, it might actually be destructive for people for whom the content hits closer to home.

In terms of gameplay, it is your basic point and click style. It isn't incredibly complex, though it can be confusing sometimes. That is really all there is to say about gameplay, because this game really is about its story.

In case you couldn't tell from what I've written so far (and believe me, that is a possibility), I loved \"That Dragon, Cancer\". When I say that, however, I don't mean in the usual way. I hated this game. I hated its premise. I hated that it had to be based off of the developer's own experience. I hated how unfair life was to this family. I hated so many things about this game, but that was the point. In interviews, the developer said that this game wasn't just about his experience, it was about cancer itself as a filthy worm, a dragon seeking to destroy everything. The point of this game was to help its players come to hate cancer as much as this family, but it was also to perhaps help those who have been affected by it to find some peace. Really, in the end, \"That Dragon, Cancer\" isn't just about Joel Green. It is about hope and faith, and it is about people and about how devastating events can lead people down different paths. \"That Dragon, Cancer\" is an absolutely beautiful game that I love and hate for all the same reasons. Normally, this is where I would give this game a score, but despite how high a score it would be, I can't bring myself to attach a numeric grade to this family's suffering. So, what I will say is this: If you can spare the $15 that it takes to buy this game on steam, then please spend it and play it at least once. If you can't spare the money, then watch somebody play it. For example, Jacksepticeye has a video of his play through, and unlike most youtubers, he handles the content with respect. Whether it is through Jacksepticeye or some youtuber or some friend, if you can't spend the money, spend the time. That is my final verdict for \"That Dragon, Cancer\".
Before I end this review, however, you may have noticed that I have not included pictures this time around. That is because I don't want to spoil so much as the art style in this game. That is how firmly I believe that you need to go and experience it.";

	$review3->title = "Determination to Succeed: A Review of Undertale";
	$review3->slug = "undertale";
	$review3->body = "If you've ever had to deal with the despicable neckbeards who call themselves \"gamers\" but play nothing but low-resolution old-school jrpg style games, then, like me, you'll perhaps be a little hesitant to give something like Undertale a try. You look at the screenshots and see humanoid animal things and you cringe. You see that you play as a kid and you cringe. I had read great things about Undertale, but it just looked like something meant exclusively for the realm of reddit worshipers and webcomic fanatics. Let me tell you how wrong these statements are. Undertale is an exemplary game. Let me tell you why. There will be no spoilers in this review, but after I score the game, I'm going to talk about the ending a bit. So, if you haven't already beaten the game, don't scroll past the score.
---------------------                                                           --------------------

I'll start off by talking a bit about the story. It has a stereotypically JRPG premise: Long ago, humans and monsters lived together in harmony, but then the humans declared war on the monsters and locked them underground. Humans then put a barrier over the underground that cannot be passed through by anything but a human. Human souls are incredibly powerful, but monster souls don't linger after death, and they just turn to dust. That kind of thing. This is what I would call the \"overarching\" backstory. Its the backstory of the world, and it is the kind of thing you always see in jrpgs. In that sense, Undertale really doesn't stand out. Where Undertale stands out is in how it handles the \"inner\" story. The whole monster and human thing is but a backdrop for a much more unique story. The inner story, the story that you take part in, has one of the most upsetting, devastating backstories of any game in recent memory. Jrpgs are typically made for children, so typically their stories are sunshine and rainbows and talking animals and moustache-twirling villains, but this is not the case in Undertale. I won't spoil the backstory, as part of the joy of this game is figuring it out for yourself, but it deals with much darker themes than other games of the same genre. Ok, I'm going to stop bashing jrpgs (even though they're trash) for now and just talk about what Undertale does.
Do you know what is really hard to do? Its really hard to tell a touching, emotional story when half your characters are anthropomorphic animal-monster things. You know what is even harder to do? It is even harder to tell a touching emotional story in that context while taking stretches of time to make whoever is experiencing the story howl with laughter. Undertale is a game with perfect tone balance, and I do mean perfect. There are long stretches of time in this game where I was crying from laughing so hard, and evenly interspersed with them are moments that made my stomach hurt because of how touching what was going on was. That is an incredible feat, and director Toby Fox should be commended for his stellar balance. It is a story that kept me captivated for the entire eight hours that it takes to beat the game.
I won't go into too many details, because you need to experience it for yourself (in every sense of the word. Folks who have already beaten it will know what I mean), but there are some parameters that you need to meet in order to get the \"true\" ending. These parameters can sometimes be a little frustrating, I will be the first to admit that. But the story remains captivating through all of it, and it all ends with the true ending; an ending that I consider to be perfect. I'll be talking about that more in depth after I score the game. So, if you've beaten the game and want to know why I think the true ending is perfect, scroll past the score when the time comes.
---------------------                                                           --------------------

Another thing that makes Undertale fantastic is its characters. Are they super three-dimensional? No. Just about every character has one character trait, but what makes that ok is how wonderfully developed every character is within the confines of that trait. Its like, despite having single character traits, every character has a well-developed backstory that somehow works its way into that single trait. Its hard to explain, so you'll just have to meet them yourself. I don't want to talk about too many of the characters, but there is one that I want to gush about right here. She is one of the first characters you meet, and her name is Toriel. She is a kind of goat thing that is, well, the scientific term for what she is is \"wonderful\". Never before has a character whose only character trait is \"nice\" been so fantastically developed. She just kind of warms your heart every time she speaks. Especially when you consider her backstory, which is just heartbreaking, you see how strong she's remained through all of the pain she's gone through, and it makes you just want to give her a big hug. I bring this up to show a point: these characters that Toby Fox has created, they are defined by single traits, but they manage to elicit emotional reactions from you if you invest yourself in their stories. That is another thing that is incredibly hard to do, and it is another thing that Mr. Fox should be commended for.
---------------------                                                           --------------------

Yet another area in which Undertale excels is in its gameplay. The premise for Undertale's gameplay is that this is a game in which you don't have to kill anybody. For every character, every boss, there is a way to win battles without killing. Your battle menu has four options: 1) Fight 2) Act 3) Item and 4) Mercy. The fight option has you attack the enemy. The act option allows you to try to talk or act your way out of conflict, and its up to you to figure out which of the act options will appease your enemy. The item option is pretty self explanatory. The mercy option allows you to flee or spare the enemy. You can only spare the enemy once they have been appeased or at least don't want to fight you anymore. If you kill an enemy, you gain EXP, which allows you to level up. If you level up, you get more HP and do more damage, but it means that you are causing more and more pain in the world. If you spare your enemies, you don't gain EXP and you don't level up, which makes things much harder going forward, but it means that you aren't hurting anybody.
The way that these battles typically work is that it takes more than one turn either to kill or spare the enemy, so, given how the combat is turn based, you spend the enemy's turn dodging their attacks. Basically there is a little box with a heart icon in it. You have to move the heart icon around to avoid attacks. No two enemies have the exact same types of attacks, and some of the bosses have attacks that are pretty meta. For instance, there is a boss that shoots attacks from various corners of the box, and you have to dodge them so that the attacks go out of the box and hit the boss. No two fights are exactly the same, and all of them require that you think outside of the box. Every kind of battle is compelling, though, and I had fun every time that I was sent into battle.

There are just a few more things to cover quickly before I score the game and go on to talk about the ending: the world itself, the puzzles, and the soundtrack. The underground is pretty much your standard jrpg setting: You've got a magma zone, you've got a snowy area, you've got a techno-y area, and you've got a caverny area. Its nothing incredibly special, but it is still a load of fun to explore.
The puzzles are not incredibly challenging, but typically they serve as a way to serve up comedy, so that is definitely forgivable. They do their job, essentially.
The soundtrack sounds like that of an old jrpg, but it is much more varied. Every boss has its own theme, and no two themes sound exactly the same. Toby Fox, who also composed the soundtrack, explores many, many genres of music in this soundtrack, all done in an old school jrpg format. Essentially, the soundtrack stands out, and it is actually quite good.

This has been perhaps the most vague review I've ever written, and there is a reason for that. There isn't a lot one can say about Undertale without spoiling the experience. There is, therefore, little left to say. But before I score this game, lets review. Undertale has a touching, hilarious story that is captivating from front to back, and it leaves off on a perfect ending. Its gameplay is unique and compelling, the world is fun to explore, the puzzles are entertaining, and the soundtrack is varied but always high quality. Not only that, but the replay value in Undertale is incredibly high. I'm currently halfway through my third playthrough, and it is just as good the third time as it was the first.
In the past I have been pretty liberal with my masterpiece seals and my 10/10s, but let me tell you something: Undertale is the kind of game that the masterpiece seal and the 10/10 score was made for. It is a downright perfect game, and unlike other games I've given this score to, I don't have a single complaint about Undertale. So, in case you haven't pieced it together, my score for Toby Fox's \"Undertale\" is:
10/10

Excellent work, Toby Fox, excellent work.

Here we go!
---------------------                                                           --------------------
Before I discuss the perfection of the true ending, I feel the need to discuss the backstory first. Now, Toby Fox is not super forthcoming about these things, it seems, so I could definitely be wrong at some points. Either way.
So, the backstory that the monsters give you in the neutral run is that a son was born to King Asgore and Queen Toriel, and they named him Asriel. Asriel was the sweetest, most good-hearted little boy ever to live. Then one day, a human fell into the underground, and, at the request of Asriel, the king and queen took the human child in. They were happy for a time, but then the human became sick and eventually died. His (or her) last request was that Asriel bury him in his old village. Asriel carried him back to the village of humans. The humans saw this monster carrying a dead human child, and they attacked him. But Asriel could not bring himself to do anything but good, so he just smiled and took the beatings and the stabbings. This is a little boy, let me remind you. After escaping from the village, Asriel collapsed in the palace and died in his father's arms. The king declared that he would take seven human souls, destroy the barrier, and make humanity pay for the death of his son.
That is the backstory that the monsters tell you, anyway.
In reality, the human child was the sheer embodiment of evil. He terrorized his new brother, Asriel, relentlessly, and Asriel followed the child's commands because he just wanted his brother to love him. The child poisoned the king, his adopted father, and when that didn't work, the child poisoned himself to make his new family suffer. He then requested that his naive, sweet-hearted brother bury him in his old village, knowing that the humans would attack him if they saw him carrying a human child. In the end, his plan worked, Asriel was killed, and the king sat underground even though he eventually found the power to pass through the barrier, all because he couldn't come to terms with the fact that deep in his heart, he forgave his evil human son for all the horrible things he did. Queen Toriel could not stand to hear the kind of hatred her husband was spouting, and she left him to guard the entry to the underground and protect humans from him.
When Toriel left, she took Asriel's ashes and scattered them in a field of gold flowers at the entrance to the underground.
Behind the scenes, though, Asgore instructed the royal scientist, Dr. Alphys, to try and recreate the power of a human soul in a non-human body. The experiments were largely a failure, but she did manage to grant an object with the will to live. The object was a golden flower, one of the flowers that Asriel's ashes had been spread on. The flower, who named itself \"Flowey,\" and who is the first character the player meets, was alive and took on all of Asriel's memories, but without a soul, he had none of Asriel's sweetness. Instead, this flower had all of the terror that the human child had caused, the memory of being beaten and stabbed to death as a child, but no soul. Flowey became convinced that there was nothing but evil in the world, and so he became the most evil of them all.
At the end of a neutral playthrough, if you choose to spare King Asgore after you fight him, Flowey enters the scene and kills him instead. He then takes all the human souls the king had acquired and became godlike. If you beat him, he tells you that if you play through again without killing a single thing, then you'd get the happy ending.
At the end of such a playthrough, you start the true ending, and all of the friends you made along the way show up to stop you from fighting Asgore, and Flowey takes all of them prisoner and steals their souls. With this, he takes on his true identity: Prince Asriel as an adult. You fight Asriel and call out to the souls of your friends, causing them to come back, but then, you sense another soul inside. You realize that, even though Asriel is long dead, his soul has come back and more or less become one with flowey. You call out to Asriel, and the thing you are fighting starts to cry, but doesn't stop fighting you. You keep on calling out to Asriel's soul, and after a few more attempts, he keeps attacking you, but he refuses to kill you, and he cries progressively more. Its at this point that Asriel takes over completely. He has mistaken you for his long lost brother, and just like in life, he just wants his brother to love him. You finally reach Asriel's soul, and he once again is a little boy, now wracked by insecurity and depression. He realizes that you aren't the brother he lost, and that he will fade away again before too long and once again become flowey. He apologizes for all of the pain he has caused as the flower, and before he leaves, you give him a big hug as he cries it out a little more.

After you embrace Asriel, it is revealed that your real name is Frisk, and the name was chose at the beginning was the name of the brother. You awaken in the palace, surrounded by your friends. You destroy the barrier, and everyone goes off to live the lives they've always dreamed of. You get the option to live in your old village or live with Toriel. The credits roll, showing the kinds of lives everyone is now leading. And then, it shows you asleep in a bed. The door to your room opens, and Toriel walks in with a piece of pie. She leaves it on the floor for you, and she gently closes the door behind her.

Allow me to tell you why this ending is perfect.
I like cyclicality in my endings, I like for endings to mirror beginnings, and this is that kind of ending. In the beginning, you take a nap and Toriel leaves you a piece of pie, and in the end the same is happening. This is the kind of sunshine and rainbows ending that I love. It doesn't feel forced. It feels like this is the kind of result you've achieved by refusing to take a life.
But there is more to it than that.
This ending is perfect because of how it handles Asriel. My heart breaks for poor little Asriel. If you think about it, the entire backstory is about the darker side of unconditional love. Asriel was just a sweet little boy who loved his brother despite all the horrible things he did, and in the end, he met a gruesome fate (as a child. Most of us sobbed our eyes out wen we scraped out knees. He was beaten and stabbed to death) because he loved everybody too much. That is what I mean when I say that the backstory is absolutely devastating. The King and Queen lost two children in one day, both of them to suicides, if you really think about it.
The reason that this ending is perfect is because, even though Asriel is only alive again for a brief time, his final memories are now feeling the love that his brother would never give him. The last thing he experiences as his soul moves on for good is a hug and forgiveness instead of fear and pain.
Even though the true ending is amazing just because of how happy a note it ends on, the thing that makes it perfect is that, in the end, you get to right one of the great wrongs of this story.

Granted, like I said, the creator tends to be a little vague here, so this is an interpretation informed by some degree of research, this is by no means the be all end all interpretation. If you have your own interpretation, shoot me an email! I love discussing this game.";

	$review4->body = "Fallout 4 is something of an oddity. When I open up a Todd Howard Bethesda game, I expect a number of things.
1) A giant, engrossing open world.
2) So many quests that I can't even count them.
3) Poor storytelling that ultimately doesn't matter in the end because its not what we play Bethesda games for.
4) Exceedingly poor character development that ultimately doesn't matter in the end for the exact same reasons as the storytelling.
These are things that are true of just about every Bethesda game that Todd Howard has a hand in, so they have become something of a standard for judgment. How, then, do we approach Fallout 4? Fallout 4 is a game that, in areas where Bethesda usually excels, definitely falls short, and it is a game that, in areas where Bethesda usually falls flat, succeeds. I'll be going into more detail about that later on, but first a note. This will be a very vague review, and it will be without pictures, because I don't want to spoil anything at all. I will be talking about the quality of many different aspects of the game, but I will for the most part be avoiding content such as names and plot details. But here's the thing, I also want to talk about spoilery things, so this is how this review is going to work. I'm going to do the spoiler-free stuff first, then I'm going to give this game its score, and then after the score I'm going to discuss spoilers. So please, for the love of everything good in the world, if you don't want things spoiled for you, don't scroll past the score.
---------------------                                                           --------------------
I suppose the first thing I should address is my statement that Fallout 4 is something of an oddity in the Bethesda cannon. This will take several sections, so I'm going to start off with the primary aspect of any Todd Howard game: the map/world. It isn't very interesting. The fact that Todd Howard managed to render a post-apocalyptic world that still looks beautiful at times is impressive, so don't get me wrong. People have been complaining about graphics, and it is true that they leave a lot to be desired, but when it really matters, they are quite impressive. The real problem with the Commonwealth is not its look, but rather the level of interest it generates. In my play through, I discovered nearly all of the landmarks (I'm still working on that), and the fact of the matter is that I'm not really interested in a lot of them. Factories just aren't that compelling, neither are sewers, neither are quarries, and these kinds of locations make up about 75% of the landmarks. That still leaves a good 25% of locations that I wanted to explore, but when I actually did the exploring, I found that not many of them had much on the inside. Fallout 3 definitely did a better job of catching my eye with locations inside and out.
The Boston setting also doesn't really do much for the map intrigue. I found that Boston was lacking in character. I definitely enjoyed exploring some of the more outskirty parts of Boston, but inner Boston, where all the skyscrapers are, was just unpleasant. In inner Boston, there are a lot of buildings, but they all look exactly the same on the inside, so after a while, exploring them lost its sense of wonder. One thing that I did appreciate was how much easier it was to navigate Boston than it was to navigate the many subway tunnels that were your only way of getting around D.C. in Fallout 3. Even though I loved the subway tunnels and the character they added to the exploration process, it was nice to not have to spend an hour going the wrong way before realizing my mistake. Make no mistake, navigating Boston isn't a cakewalk, but it is considerably easier. Considerably easier doesn't necessarily mean more fun, though. I really hate to use this word as a negative in a game about the post-apocalypse, but Boston is just plain ugly. The rest of the wasteland is ugly, but its ugly in a way that has a charisma about it. Like Fallout 3, most of the wasteland has a sort of rustic charm to it that gives the intentional ugly a purpose. But Boston has none of that charm. It is just ugly in an ugly way. Once again, let me reiterate that I'm not talking about graphics. I'm talking about design. And the design of Boston, while littered with hidden crannies left and right, almost discourages exploration. The same could not be said of D.C. in Fallout 3. I spent hours upon hours exploring D.C. because it seemed to call to me. The look of D.C. seemed to say, \"come explore me, I have stuff!\" Boston, on the other hand, didn't look like it would have anything of value in it. This is a valid assertion, as I only came across something of value once (a suit of the best kind of power armor inside of an unmarked building) in Boston. Everything else was just freaking pipe weapons. It is in instances like that where I can see what folks mean when they say that Fallout 4 is the Skyrim to Fallout 3's Oblivion. The loot in Skyrim was horrible, and most of the loot in Fallout 4 was horrible as well. To elaborate, I kept most of the weapons I found towards the beginning of the game with me for the entire game. That is how little quality stuff is out there. Even the loot from the so-called \"legendary\" enemies is not really worth it. There will be more on that later.
So, what is the Commonwealth like outside of Boston? Like in Fallout 3, there are big cities and there are small settlements. While all the big cities in Fallout 4 are better than the horrible Rivet City of Fallout 3, unfortunately, they are all somewhat lacking. The main big city feels like a pint-sized version of Megaton, and while I actually really loved one of the smaller big cities, even it was lacking in the same kind of appeal that Megaton had. It is very hard to elaborate on this point without spoiling anything, so let me just say this: It feels like a lot less passion went into the creation of these cities.
Really, the major strength of this game's map is its smaller settlements. These smaller settlements are better than the small settlements in Fallout 3, even with less named characters involved. This is due in no small part to the crafting system that allows you to make these settlements your own. I'll be elaborating more on that in the crafting segment of this review.
---------------------                                                           --------------------
I suppose the next thing to discuss is the quest aspect of Fallout 4. Fallout: New Vegas blew like crazy, in my book. It was just awful. But one thing that it did really well was in the sheer amount of quests you could undertake. Fallout 3 didn't have very many quests, and that has carried over into Fallout 4. Don't get me wrong, there is an unlimited supply of quests you can undertake in Fallout 4. Does that sound like a contradiction? Let me elaborate. In Skyrim, Todd Howard took steps into the absolutely shameful world of randomly generated quests. Let me say this right up front: Randomly generated quests are HORRIBLE! They are uninspired! Thats why No Man's Sky is actually not going to be good. But that is a conversation for another day. Most of the quests in Fallout 4 (I would legitimately say around 90%) are randomly generated quests, so if you hate rgq's, then you're going to be lacking in quests. Now, here's the silver lining. They are very well done and well disguised rgqs. So well disguised, in fact, that I played nothing but rgqs for four nights straight before I realized it. The problem is that once you do enough of them, they start showing their pattern, and you recognized them for what they are. I still hate rgqs, but I will give Todd Howard this: They are very well done in comparison to the ones in Skyrim. These rgqs will usually get you something nice, like a new settlement or a new kind of weapon. So, I suppose if we must go down the rgq route, this is the way to do it.
But that doesn't excuse the fact that there aren't very many quests outside of those that are randomly generated. I beat the game last night, so I looked up a list of all the quests, and I found that I had completed all but maybe 1 or 2 of them. That is very disappointing, especially considering that most of the quests are boring fetch endeavors. The thing about Fallout 3 that made the lack of lots of quests ok was the fact that all of them were compelling. The same cannot be said of Fallout 4. Its always fetch this or fetch that, and it is annoying. Its like, Todd Howard sets up some fantastic scenarios with these quests and then shoots himself in the foot by telling you to go and fetch something instead of directly taking any part.
Really, the main quests are more interesting than the side quests, but I can't really say anything about that until the spoiler section.
---------------------                                                           --------------------
Now lets talk crafting. Normally, I'm not really into crafting. I like to make do with what I can find or with what I have (When I was still a new gamer, I completed approximately 100 hours of Oblivion in just tan linens and the rough leather cuirass that I found in the opening dungeon). You cannot craft weapons or armor, but you can modify what you already have. It is sometimes engaging and it sometimes gets you the kinds of results you want, but its nothing groundbreaking. I maybe made use of it once to put a scope on a rifle I had, but for even the most crazed crafting fans, it isn't going to occupy much of your time.
The settlement crafting mechanic is a step up, and it is a promising start, but it is still a little awkward. I spent a lot of time arming my settlements with turrets and tall towers of steel. It is a nice system that gets you a little more invested in your settlements and the settlers. You can start gardens, set up water purifiers, build houses, and set up trade routes between your settlements. It really makes you feel like you're having some sort of impact. The problem is that the process of building structures is very awkward. How so? Well, the ground in most settlements is not at all level. I am not OCD, but it does bother me when things aren't symmetrical or even. If you're like me in that regard, then the settlement crafting is going to drive you nuts. Because the ground is so often not level, you will end up with floating floor panels or floor panels buried somewhat under the ground, and it just gets really annoying. Not only that, but the size of settlements is sometimes misleading. I once cleared out a spot for a settlement in what looked like a full pre-war town. That would have been awesome! I certainly went through enough work killing ghouls to justify having a whole town. But no! The settlement was just a small house, driveway, and little stretch of land at the edge of the town. Why?! Why?! What justification in the WORLD would I have to just build a settlement on that little plot when I just cleared out a whole TOWN with GROCERY STORES and POLICE PROTECTRONS??! Are people in the commonwealth that stupid? This kind of thing happens far too often in Fallout 4, where you'll think you're getting to set up this big settlement, but really you just get a small plot of land. The thing that really gets me annoyed about it, though, is when I'm setting up a settlement along the coast and the workshop area ends right where the water starts. Instead of setting up an industrial sized water purifier in the giant body of water that is right there to get my settlers their water, I have to set up fifteen water pumps. And don't say its because seawater doesn't work, because on SOME of the coastal settlements, it lets you use the ocean. Its just very inconsistent and awkward and it ultimately takes away from the settlement creating experience.
---------------------                                                           --------------------
If you're still with me, you may recall that I said Fallout 4 excels where Bethesda usually falls short. Its time to talk about what that means.
Todd Howard is many things, but a storyteller he is not. His strength has always been in his worldbuilding, and story has always just been table dressing for it. However, this is not the case in Fallout 4...at least, not for a while. I won't give any details, but for at least the first 80% of the story, it is absolutely compelling, and actually really touching at some points. However, after that first 80%, Todd Howard kind of drops everything that made it compelling and turns in an entirely new direction. It all leads to the most disappointing final push in recent memory. I thought for sure that the final push, given the decisions I'd made, would hurt me deep down, but not in this way. Todd Howard had every opportunity to make the absolutely soul-crushing, depressing final confrontation of all time, but instead what we got was something that felt rushed and took none of the opportunities given to it. I will be discussing this at length when I do the spoiler section after the score, so if you've already beaten the game, then scroll past the score when the time comes. I need to rant about how horribly this ending was handled to someone. Like, seriously, On my way to the final confrontation, I was sick to my stomach thinking about how depressing it was going to be, and it was so disappointing.
But lets focus on the good 80%. Like in any Bethesda game, it is very easy to ignore the main quests in favor of going off exploring or doing side quests, but Fallout 4 does something that no other Bethesda game does. In every Bethesda game, there comes a point where I decide, \"well, I'd better do some of the main quest now\". That doesn't happen in Fallout 4. Rather, there comes points in which I decide that I want to go off and do main story stuff. It isn't a huge thing, but it does make a difference, and it says something about how compelling the first 80% of the story is.
---------------------                                                           --------------------
Another thing that Todd Howard has not historically good at is character development. Like story, characters tend to be just table dressing for the worlds he creates, and we let it slide because that is just how it is. However, in Fallout 4, we see that Todd Howard has taken a class or two. Character development is at an all time high in Fallout 4. Like in New Vegas and 3, you can take on companions to travel with you. But unlike previous games, Fallout 4's companions really feel alive and make a difference in your experience. There are, I believe, somewhere around 13 companions you can take on. Not all of them are well-developed or pleasant to have along, but those that are well-developed and that you take a liking to are a joy to have along for the ride. There were five characters that I absolutely loved to death. I enjoyed traveling the world with them, and for the first time in Bethesda history, companions added something to the experience.
In Fallout 4, Bethesda takes a nod to Bioware in that companions like you at varying degrees based upon your actions. If you maxed out your approval rating with a companion, you'd get a new perk, and for some of the companions, you would have the option to be romantically involved with them. More on that in just a sec. First I need to make a negative point.
As your companions like you more and more, they open up to you a bit more and tell them a bit more about their background. However, outside of these instances, you don't really get to talk to them all that much. You can hear their lines over and over again and you can constantly probe them as to the quality of your relationship, but you don't really get to hold conversations with them. In the end, that wasn't a big thing, but I still would have liked to have seen a little more interaction involved. These are Todd Howard's absolute masterworks in terms of character development, so it would have been great to be able to get to know them a little better. In the past, Todd Howard has been exclusively \"tell, don't show\" in his development, and this time around he is exclusively \"show, don't tell\". Some inbetween would be nice next time.
Now, romance. Todd Howard took his first steps into the modern gaming convention of the protagonist's choice romantic subplot in Skyrim with the introduction of the marriage mechanic. It was awful and pointless, but it was a step in a different direction. This time around, Todd Howard gives us a much more fulfilling realization of the romantic subplot. You cannot romance anyone who doesn't absolutely idolize you, and you have to pass certain persuasion parameters in order to actually sway your love interest. In this way, it is much more realistic (well, as realistic as anything in a Bethesda game can be) than the Skyrim system. If you haven't earned their trust enough, or if you aren't good enough with words, then you will not succeed in starting a romantic relationship with a companion. I always play Fallout with max charisma, so this wasn't a problem for me, but it was still a nice idea.
It is here where I must commend Todd Howard on his thoughtfulness. One thing that you cannot say about Todd Howard is that he handles gore or sex immaturely. On the contrary, he handles mature subject matter like an adult, and in a game as gory as Fallout tends to be, that is a big deal. If you read my review of \"The Witcher III\", then you know that I praised CD Projekt Red on how maturely they handled the sensuality in comparison to their previous games. Well, Fallout doesn't have a history to compare to, but Todd Howard handles this content more maturely than any developer I've seen.
What this means is that we don't have to awkwardly sit through horrifying animated sex scenes (a-la The Witcher 2) or listen in horror as the screen turns black and...um...sounds...(a-la Fable). In fact, such things are not even remotely implied. Todd Howard seems to make a point of saying that sexual content isn't needed to convey romance, which is something that I really appreciate. Rather, here is what goes down. If you sleep in a bed while you are either traveling with your romantic companion or in the same settlement as them, you awake with a temporary bonus to experience earning called \"Lover's Embrace\", and you awake to a sweet line from them. For instance, while I was on a mission to clear out raiders from a quarry, I needed to heal without medicine, so I slept for an hour in a nearby bed inside the same quarry. I was traveling with my love interest, so the first thing I heard upon my character waking up was, in an \"I just woke up\" voice, \"Wakey wakey, Blue (this character's nickname for the protagonist). Time to get going.\" This wasn't totally sappy, nor was it suggestive in any way. It was just something remarkably human, something reflective of the world these people live in. Where has this version of Todd Howard been all my life? In short, the romantic subplot is not only handled maturely, it is also portrayed in a very human way, and Mr. Howard deserves no end of praise for it.
---------------------                                                           --------------------
At this point I've discussed every part of my opening statement, but there are still things to discuss before I score this game and go into spoilers. The first thing is gameplay.
Gameplay is much more action-centered than in Fallout 3. For some, that will be a good thing, and for some that will be a bad thing. I tend to be pretty split on that kind of thing. But here's the thing: The gameplay is more like an FPS this time around, but it is better FPS gameplay than most, and that is commendable. There is more balance between VATS and real-time gameplay this time around as well. There are times when VATS is more effective for combat, and there are times when you are better off just using your ironsights. It becomes a matter of moving fluidly between the two.
Like in previous games, there are many ways to play. In my play through, I alternated evenly between my super sledge and my arsenal of guns, and I can say that both methods of play are satisfying, though the melee is definitely frustrating at times, as you get interrupted mid swing for just about nothing more often than not.
---------------------                                                           --------------------
Another aspect of previous Fallout games that is present in Fallout 4 is the radio. This time around, you have two or three radio stations: Diamond City Radio, Classical Radio, and if you do the right quest, Radio Freedom. DCR plays jazz songs, Classical plays, you guessed it, classical music, and Freedom plays early american folk violin pieces. DCR has some good new songs, but it recycles too many songs from Fallout 3. There were more Ella Fitzgerald songs, and Ella Fitzgerald is my favorite singer, period, so I appreciated that, but really, my favorite was the Classical station. It had more variety, and it had a fantastic selection. The only problem with it is that sometimes its selections don't quite fit...for example, flight of the valkyries doesn't really work with the mood of the game.

I feel the need to weigh in on the new dialogue system and the voiced protagonist. The voice actor and actress for the protagonist (depending on the gender you play as) are both fantastic, or at least better than any Bioware protagonist's voice actor. The new dialogue system, however, I must admit, is subpar. I had to stop and consider what the tone of each option might be, and generally the bottom one is the nice, diplomatic one, but not always, and that really threw me off. It isn't game-breaking, but you will notice some frustration with it. Also, there aren't cutscenes, no matter how much they look like they are. Rather, in dialogue, the camera changes to make it look like a cutscene. This means that occasionally characters will walk away while they're talking to you and it really messes things up.

Needless to say, this wouldn't be a Bethesda game without bugs. You can expect the usual: objects in walls, companions not being able to jump, framerate drops, and some crashes. I only had the game crash once in my two weeks of playing it, but framerate drops were common especially in the inner Boston area. All in all, I experienced less bugs in Fallout 4 than in most other Bethesda games.

All right. The time has come to score this baby. I have been struggling with my feelings with Fallout 4. There are some ways in which it is really not up to par with Todd Howard's previous work. However, in areas where Mr. Howard doesn't usually excel, we see him excel in this game. How does one approach a game such as that when the rules are flipped? I've known from my first night in the wasteland that it wasn't going to be 10/10 material. But at the same time, I knew that I was going to enjoy it, and enjoy it I did. Fallout 4 has some of the smallest payoff for all your hard work of any game in recent memory, but the journey, while a shadow of what it could have been, is astounding. I find myself needing to break my own grading rules. Up until this point I have not gone inbetween numbers. Meaning, games are either a 10 or a 9 or an 8 or so on, not 8.5s or 9.1s. Well, for Fallout 4 I need to go inbetween numbers, because neither number on either side fits it. In case it is unclear, because it looks like I have done little but complain, I recommend that you go out and get Fallout 4 the instant you get the chance. On your journeys, you meet a colorful cast of characters that you end up getting attached to more than any Bethesda companions from days of old. You experience a touching story about what it is to be human that, for a while, compels you to fight all the horrors of the wasteland in order to achieve your goal. Along the way, you'll realize that there isn't a lot to this world, but the people in it are what give the journey its strength. You'll come to care about certain characters and come to find joy in finally seeing other characters' brains splattered on the ground in front of you. And in the end, you'll wonder why you bothered. But then you'll look back on the people you've met, the settlements you've set up, the good times that you and your companions have had, the times you've nearly died at the hands of a Deathclaw, and you'll remember why.
8.9/10

So, if you're like me, the revelation that the main villain is none other than Shaun, your kidnapped son, whom you assumed was still a child came as a shock. It was very well executed, but after that, the whole thing is kind of dropped. I mean, they still pull heartbreaking things like finding out that he is dying. So, after over 200 years of being frozen and finally finding your son twice your age, you find out that he won't be here long. Then when he appoints you as the director of his organization, placing blind trust in you, his father, that you will run his ultimately evil empire, it is even more heartbreaking. That is why I was so afraid of the final confrontation. I sided with the railroad and went to take down the institute, and when I got on the elevator to face the music, I knew that I was going to have to look my dying son in the eyes and tell him that I was here to destroy everything he'd spent his entire life working on. That should have been an absolutely sickeningly sad scene, but it isn't handled that way. He just tells you that it is too late to say sorry and that you've doomed the world, and tells you to go away. It was very underwhelming. I was sick to my stomach on the way up to see him because I was expecting so much heartbreak, but I was let down.

Another thing that really irked me about the story end was the fact that you have to blow up the Institute's nuclear reactor. Like, how stupid is that? If we've managed to infiltrate the institute and kill everyone inside and take it all over, why can't we use the technology they've created to help the Commonwealth? I mean, come on! They have found ways to grow non-radiated food! They've come up with technology that will change the world! We wouldn't have to use it to make slaves of everyone! It just didn't make a lot of sense to me that, in order to destroy the institute, we had to destroy the most promising source of energy the wasteland has ever seen.
---------------------                                                           --------------------
And another thing. Why does the Brotherhood of Steel decide to come and try to destroy the Railroad if you side with them? I mean, I get that they would try to get you considering that if you've sided with the Railroad, you have done something to the Brotherhood, but as much of an arrogant holier-than-thou superiority complex entity as the Brotherhood is, attacking innocents isn't usually what they do. Yet, in my play through, the Brotherhood of steel became responsible for kidnappings and all out assaults on peaceful settlements. I enjoyed slaughtering Brotherhood members like flies and making more suits of power armor out of the armor of fallen knights after that, but it still seemed a little too forced.

	$review5->body = "The Chinese Room's \"Everybody's Gone to the Rapture\" is evidence of two things: 1) The Chinese Room has not learned a single thing since \"Dear Esther,\" however 2) They have stepped up their game a thousandfold. If you enjoyed \"Dear Esther,\" then you will undoubtedly enjoy \"Everybody's Gone to the Rapture.\" The reason for this is that Rapture does everything that Esther did, but it does them infinitely better. The downside to this, however, is that Rapture suffers from all the problems that Esther did, and this time around these problems have a much greater negative impact. These opening statements have probably made me sound conflicted, but that is not the case. I am very well aware that Rapture is one of the best games I've played this year and one of the best storytelling games to ever grace the market. With this in mind, though, I cannot discount the negatives, as they really hold this game back from what it could be. Here is the premise of \"Everybody's Gone to the Rapture:\" In a small English parish, all the townsfolk have gone missing or have died. You don't really have an objective except to find somewhere (I won't tell you where, as that would ruin everything), but what ends up happening is you learn about what happened through memories of the townsfolk. I will discuss this more in depth later, but for now, lets get started.
---------------------                                                           --------------------

I'll start this off by discussing the negatives. Like in \"Dear Esther,\" your walking speed is infuriating. The purpose of these games is not to rush through everything, I get that, and I agree with it, but for crying out loud, give us some middle ground, Chinese Room! If I end up having to backtrack, I want to be able to do it at a better pace. Now, one thing that they don't tell you is that you can walk faster, but it is kind of a contrived way to do so. Basically, you hold down R2, and after a few seconds, you start to walk faster. It does make a noticeable difference, but it is incredibly annoying to have to do that for hours on end. I just would appreciate getting more pacing options. I love to hike, but I'm not one of those people who has to stop every two steps to admire the scenery. I am somebody who is capable of appreciating the scenery entirely while on the move. The Chinese Room really needs to get its act together next time, as the walking speed has been a complaint from just about everyone for both Dear Esther and Rapture.
---------------------                                                           --------------------

The only other negative is one that hits especially hard. In \"Dear Esther,\" there was a remarkable emptiness to the world, meaning you couldn't interact with anything. Your only exploration was walking. The same is true in Rapture. Your only means of exploring this narrative world is through your walking around and looking at things. I would have liked some degree of interactivity, even if it were just spinning a globe or something. The point is: while the world is incredibly well designed, the physical world just feels like a paint job. This was a problem with Dear Esther, but it is a sin in this game. You might call it nitpicking, or you might say that I'm missing the point of this game. To counter that, I would point you to the middle portions of Rapture. It is an unfortunate truth that in the middle two sections of the game, exploration kind of loses some of its charm. 4 out of every 5 doors are locked, and eventually, I just gave up on trying to explore houses altogether (until the final section), because none of the houses were accessible and I just ended up having to backtrack. Not only that, but there were many more fences in the middle portions, which meant that if I went to one of those inaccessible houses, I would have to spend even longer backtracking. My point here is that there are far too many restrictions in Rapture, and it legitimately took away from my experience.
---------------------                                                           --------------------

Now, lets move on to the positives of this game. One area where Rapture excels is in its beauty. The world is absolutely stunning everywhere you go. From the rural areas with the smaller houses to the pubs in town, you can expect every inch of this world to be rendered with loving detail. This is part of the reason why Rapture is so engrossing. You feel like you are in this world the entire time that you play.
It would be a sin to talk about the beauty of this game without mentioning the soundtrack. Folk music is my favorite kind of music, so perhaps I'm a little biased in this regard, but the entire soundtrack is made up of English folk music. There are choral arrangements of folk tunes, and even the instrumental pieces are heavily influenced by English folk composers such as my favorite composer of all time, Ralph Vaughan Williams. Folk simply oozes out of this game's soundtrack. There is no point in which the folk influence is sacrificed for extra conventional beauty. In other words, there are times when there are dissonances, but the game embraces them because in certain circles of folk music, occasional dissonances are embraced. My point is that there is a level of dedication in the music for Rapture that I have not seen anywhere else. 
---------------------                                                           --------------------

The real driving force of Rapture, though, is the character development and the story. Rapture sports a small cast of characters, just the right amount for a small English parish. Everybody knows everybody and people just come over to visit at the most random times. If you have ever once lived in a small town or fantasized about doing so, then this game will touch you on a spiritual level. Every last character in this game is developed to the point where you can absolutely see them even though there are no character models in this game. This is thanks to stellar, character-specific writing and by far the greatest voice acting of any game ever made. That is not an exaggeration. There has never been better voice acting in a game. There isn't a single weak link in this statement; everybody plays their character with passion and skill, and it makes the world come alive.
In terms of story, The Chinese Room takes a similar approach to Dear Esther. Nothing is explained in black and white terms. At the end, you still don't know exactly what happened, and it doesn't matter because the experience of getting there was so good. Let me explain that a little better. You have some idea of what happened, and with that little bit of knowledge, The Chinese Room sets up a believable conflict and believable drama. It doesn't even take you knowing everything for The Chinese Room to make their story believable. That is talent the likes of which I don't see very often. That is what I mean when I say that this game is evidence that they have stepped up their game a thousandfold. This approach worked in Dear Esther, but it works infinitely better here. At the end, you still don't know everything you might like to know, but it still leaves you slack-jawed and saying \"wow\" to yourself.
---------------------                                                           --------------------

I absolutely agonized over the score for this game. In the middle portions of the game, I legitimately considered giving it a 7/10. I loved it at that time, but the portion I was in was just so restrictive that I felt it was what the game had earned. After I beat the game, I considered ramping it up to an 8/10, just because the first and last sections were good enough to negate some of the restrictions of the middle. Then I took a good night's sleep, and when I woke up, I considered giving it a 9/10, because this is one of those games where, the more you think about it, the more you like it. So, what we have are three scores: 7/10, 8/10, 9/10. In my opinion, \"Everybody's Gone to the Rapture\" could feasibly earn any of these scores, depending on how you look at it. I don't do \".5\"s, which makes the decision even more difficult. But as of now, I have made my decision. Here is what I am basing it off of: Yes, there were many, many, many restrictions that legitimately took away from the experience, but in the end, what was it that I remembered? What was it about this game that stayed with me? The answer was not the restrictions. The restrictions, which they hindered the experience, were not what remained in my heart and kept me smiling for hours upon hours after finishing. In the end, it was the fantastic story, the phenomenal character development and voice acting, the raw, folksy beauty of the whole thing, and the unbridled passion that went into the development of this project that makes \"Everybody's Gone to the Rapture,\" a must-play experience. Just keep in mind that there are some drawbacks, but that they are nothing compared to this game's beauty.
9/10
Excellent work, The Chinese Room, excellent work.

I didn't play the original Infamous, but I did play Infamous 2, which was quite good in that there was plenty of raw fun in running around New Marais and doing some of the side things you could do. Second Son was lacking in just about every way possible. Here is the premise: It has been a few years since the events of Infamous 2, and a new government agency, the \"Department of Unified Protection,\" has started rounding up Conduits (superheroes) and relabeling them, \"Bioterrorists.\" There isn't a lot more to say in an introduction, so lets just get right to it.
---------------------                                                           --------------------

Delsin Rowe is an insufferable punk. 
I suppose the first thing to discuss is our hero/villain, Delsin Rowe. He is a young Native American who wears a beanie and a jean jacket with all sort of colorful buttons on it. Oh, and he also wears converse shoes and likes to spray paint on buildings. Let me be clear: In this way, Delsin is a little more human than Cole \"gravel-voice\" McGrath...but come on. All he needs now is a relative who is a police officer and we're go...oh wait...he does have a relative who is a police officer. *sigh* Basically, Delsin Rowe is a walking stereotype the likes of which you see at skate parks and hanging out with their friends in places where they are as visible as they can possibly be. You can see Delsin's report card clearly just by looking at him, and that is a pretty good metaphor for his character. Upon seeing him, I imagined that I was in for a protagonist full of awful jokes and attempts to be witty. I was not disappointed...well, I mean, I was, but you know what I mean. You look at this guy and what you see is what you get. I can't imagine that the team who worked on him was made up of anything but men in their 40's with the unshakable belief that the law is always right...which is kind of contradictory given the content of the game, but still. If you were to ask such a person what teenagers are like nowadays, they would describe Delsin Rowe in detail, and that is a problem. Delsin's character has some touching moments, but they are quickly thrown aside in favor of witty quips such as \"better than ice cream\" after winning a fight. I'm sorry, sucker punch, am I playing Infamous or Sonic the Hedgehog?
---------------------                                                           --------------------

Morality is, as it always is in Infamous, embarrassingly simple. 
While we're on the subject of Delsin, I feel it is an opportune time to talk about the morality system. The morality in Infamous has always been laughably binary, but this takes it to a whole new level. With Cole McGrath, his character was vague enough that if you went and slaughtered thousands of innocents, it might have been believable, but with Delsin it makes no sense. That is the price you pay for trying to develop characters a little further; some things just don't make sense if the character does them. At the beginning of the game, we see Delsin have a really sweet exchange with Betty, one of the village leaders. Nothing about what we know of Delsin suggests that he would be ok with killing hundreds of people. 
Not only that, but the rewards for following one karmic path or another are disappointing. In previous Infamous games you had access to entirely different abilities depending on your path. However, in Second Son, you get a single move and a different jacket. There really is no reason to follow one karmic path or another, because it doesn't change anything in the plot until the very end. No matter what path you follow, everything from gameplay style to character allegiances are pretty much exactly the same. 
---------------------                                                           --------------------

Eugene Sims is a gamer...which means he wears glasses and is afraid of talking to girls...nice one, Sucker Punch.
This leads us to characters. Infamous has never been famous for its character development, but it really goes the extra mile in the wrong direction here. The game starts off fooling us, introducing us to Betty, one of the village leaders in the Native American community that Delsin lives in. She is a fantastic character that drives the events of the game forward...for about five minutes. Every time that Infamous: Second Son introduces us to a well-developed character (save for one), they end up getting dropped within a few minutes. The star players in this game are all stereotypes: A junkie, a bald prisoner guy, a geeky video game guy, and the police officer brother who is incapable of thinking anything negative about any law ever. They do not get much more developed from there. 
---------------------                                                           --------------------

Brooke Augustine is incredibly hatable, in a good villain sort of way.
There is, however, one character that stands out above all the rest: The main villain, Brooke Augustine. We are first introduced to her very early on in the game, and boy, does she make an entrance. Right from her very first line, she is simply radiating with evil, and within the first few minutes of her being there, we grow to absolutely hate her guts. I. Hated. Her. In a good way, I mean, like, the way a villain should make you hate them. Every time she enters the scene, it is memorable, and she is without a doubt the best part of this game. It is simply amazing that, in a game with so many poorly developed, stereotypical characters, such a strong villain could possibly exist. Brooke Augustine is the head of the Department of Unified Protection despite being a conduit herself, with the power to control concrete. She takes every opportunity she can to torture other conduits with concrete spikes, and she is infamous for the horrific things that happen in the prison she set up. But Infamous: Second Son manages to destroy her as well. At the end of the game, we learn her true motivations, and not only are they as cliche as possible, they don't make sense...at all. But up until the end, Brooke Augustine is absolutely the greatest part of Infamous: Second Son. 
---------------------                                                           --------------------

Seattle looks fantastic, but it is pretty boring. 
Now that we've got all the story stuff out of the way, lets talk about gameplay. Before I get to the powers, I'd like to talk about the map. Infamous is a saga of varied locations. First we were in Empire City (a comic-ized version of New York), then we were in New Marais (a comic-ized version of New Orleans), and with Second Son, we are magically whisked away to the quirky comic book city of...Seattle. Just...Seattle. There wasn't even an attempt to change the name or anything...just Seattle. You see, there is a problem when you try to set a game in a real city in the present day. It sounds all well and good on paper, but it just never works out well. Why? Because it is a constraint! If you do that, you are bound to what the city looks like with maybe one or two alterations, and REAL MODERN CITIES ARE NOT INTERESTING! For actual exploration and experience, real modern cities are quite exciting, but they are NOT good GAME settings! I defy you to name an open world game that takes place in an actual modern city that is good (meaning, not GTA V, because Los Santos doesn't exist). I've been to Seattle, and it is pretty awesome, but it would be an awful place for an open world game. The beauty of Seattle is in its unique aesthetic and the way it looks in real life. Computerizing it and making it into a game takes all of that away, and it just because a bland, rainy location. This is exactly what is wrong with Second Son's rendering of Seattle. In addition, Seattle is more than just the densely populated city areas! I went hiking there by the sea, and it was fantastic! But Second Son doesn't take any of the unique natural areas available into account. Instead its all, \"oooooh look, we have the spaaaaaaace neeeeedle!\" In addition, get this: Second Son doesn't even include the cool real-life locations that are within the city portion of the city! It is literally just the space needle! Point being, the setting of Second Son is boring, and it takes none of the opportunities it could take to make it more interesting. It looked amazing, thanks to what the PS4 is capable of, but that just isn't enough. 
---------------------                                                           --------------------

There's a lot to do in Seattle...it just isn't anything engaging. 
When it comes to the map, Infamous has a history of making exploration compelling with collectables and the like. In Infamous 2, I spent entire nights just wandering the map collecting blast shards. Second Son, on the other hand, falls flat in this regard. Sure, there are things to do and collectables to find, but I beat the entire game in 2 nights...TWO nights to get 100% completion, and I was only playing for about 5 hours a night. 10 hours total is not a bad plot length, though I would prefer longer...but thats the thing, though! That isn't the plot length! That is the plot length plus doing absolutely everything else you could possibly do! And that is shameful. 
One thing that I did initially enjoy about the game world, however, was the reactive nature of the civilians. I played as a hero, and thus every time I passed, people were taking pictures of me with their phones and shouting \"I want to have your babies, Delsin!\" It was a small touch that made the world seem more responsive to my actions...but then the civilians started saying things like, \"Yeah! Too cool for school!\" and I knew that there was no escape for Second Son's lackluster writing, and that was the end of my enjoyment of that. 
---------------------                                                           --------------------

The neon power is fantastic. The rest...are ok.
Alright, now we come to the powers themselves. Delsin is essentially Peter Petrelli from \"Heroes,\" in that he duplicates the powers of other conduits. His starting power is smoke, and through the course of the game he also gets neon, video, and eventually concrete. The problem is that, save for neon, most of the powers are not really fun. The smoke just feels...lacking in some way. It is the least mobile power by far and the abilities that it brings are just...so very standard. The video has a refreshing mobility to it, but in combat it just feels clunky and weird. You don't even get concrete until the very end and afterwards, so it doesn't even make a difference if you're like me and 100%-ed before the end. Really, the only compelling power is the neon. It gives this game the sense of mobility that it needs thanks to its movement ability, which is running really fast and running up and over any obstacles in your way seamlessly. The combat abilities that come with neon are by far the best. The neon abilities are based on precision. For example, when you hold down a certain button, you can pretty much instantly incapacitate an enemy by hitting them with a blast on the knee or kill them by hitting them on the head. Call me biased, but I enjoyed the ability to switch between explosive battle and precision strikes on the fly. 
One other thing that was enjoyable in certain powers is the karmic power. Essentially, when you build up a big enough karmic streak (kill x amount of people in x time/restrain x enemies without killing a single person), you get to unleash an attack that takes out a number of enemies. For smoke, it is a dive bomb attack that SUCKS! It doesn't feel accurate, and enemies can easily dodge it. For neon, it is a giant attack that puts enemies in floating bubbles that you then blow up in multiple places by way of machine gunning neon. That one is AWESOME, and it is effective. For video, you summon lots of angels that dive bomb enemies, and that one is inbetween neon and smoke in terms of quality. I don't know what concrete was, because there was no reason to keep playing the game after I got that power. 
---------------------                                                           --------------------

Infamous: Second Son has some good qualities, but it just isn't very good.
So, in the end, how is Infamous: Second Son not exactly a bad game? It is very easy to crucify this game because it does so many things wrong. It has a boring and poorly designed location, the powers are pretty much hit or miss, the characters are flat, and the greatest character in the game isn't even safe from Second Son's corrupting influence. But the bottom line is that, as long as I was playing with the neon power, it was a joy to run around the city in my neon stream. The neon gameplay was almost like a different game because of how enjoyable it was. In addition, even though Brooke Augustine stopped being compelling at the end, she was compelling enough through the rest of the game to make up for that. These are, however, the only real positives to the game. They save Infamous: Second Son from the status of \"bad\" game, but they are not good enough to rescue it from \"just not very good\" status.

	$review7->body = "Geralt of Rivia and I have a somewhat inconsistent history. My first experience in the world of the Witcher was The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings, which I would probably have given a 7. While it was, of course, a cinematic marvel, it was just not a particularly good game. Then, a year ago, I got the original Witcher game on steam for $3, and I absolutely loved it. So, as you can probably tell, there isn't much consistency with my views on CD Projekt Red's saga. On one hand, I've always admired the unique interpretations of everything from monsters to races, but on the other hand, there has always been something missing that I can't quite describe. But I'm not writing this to talk about The Witchers I and II. I'm here to talk about the latest entry in the saga: \"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.\" I was fortunate enough to have saved up enough money for a PS4 recently, so I was able to play it (speaking of which, there will be a large influx of reviews coming in before too long, because I've gone through a few PS4 games). Let me first explain the premise here: It is maybe...a year or so after the events of Assassins of Kings, and the Witcher, Geralt of Rivia, is looking for his old lover, Yennefer of Vengeberg (or however you spell it). From there, the plot turns to a quest to find Ciri, the heir to the Nilfgaardian throne, and Geralt and Yennefer's surrogate daughter, a child of the elder blood who is perhaps the most powerful force in the world. There is just one complication: The Wild Hunt, otherworldly wraiths who are after the elder blood, are pursuing Ciri. That is all I'll say of the plot itself. To start off this review, let me say this: The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is not without its flaws, but it is without a doubt the best Witcher game and, though it will be up against the likes of Fallout 4 and Batman: Arkham Knight, it is heavily in the running for my Game of the Year for 2015.

Swimming is...awkward, to say the least.
I'm not entirely sure where to start. I guess, since there are so many positives to this game, I'll go ahead and get the negatives out of the way.
The thing that most took away from Wild Hunt, for me, was swimming (which says something about the quality of the game, given that you are only forced to swim a few times, and that is what I disliked the most). It just feels...off. On the surface, it is just like any other RPG swimming, but once you dive below the surface, it feels like you lose control over Geralt completely. He never quite seems to do what you tell him to do, and I found that half the time I ended up drowning because Geralt wouldn't operate the way he was supposed to. But, like I said, you are only forced to swim for story quests a few times, and most of the treasures you can find are on solid ground anyway.
The other thing that really bugged me is an even smaller issue, but it was infinitely more present than the swimming: the candles. You see, since Geralt has some control over fire because of his \"igni\" sign, he can light and extinguish candles with magic...the problem being that every person you need to talk to and every thing you need to interact with happens to be standing right by a candle. What this means is that you will need to talk to someone to get a quest or a reward, and you will just end up lighting and extinguishing the nearby candle over and over again. This is a problem in just about every area of the game throughout, and it is infuriating. If you remember playing Fallout 3 and trying to pick up the ammo in the toilet without drinking the water, then the candle thing is a lot like that. I only really have one other large complain, and I will get to that later on.
---------------------                                                           --------------------

Combat is responsive and a joy to take part in.
Now, on to the positives. I suppose the first thing I should talk about is gameplay. I loved the gameplay in the original Witcher and disliked it in Assassins of Kings. What we have with Wild Hunt is not so much a middle ground as it is a greatly improved version of Assassins of Kings' gameplay. Like Assassins of Kings, combat in Wild Hunt is largely action-based with a side of tactical requirement. You have your steel weapon for humanoid enemies and your silver weapon for monsters and your magic signs to give you an extra edge and potions to use. Combat is mainly sword play and dodging, and it has a nice responsiveness to it that Assassins of Kings lacked. Geralt rolls where you need him to roll, and that is a vast improvement. Wild Hunt is not an incredibly hard game, but parrying and riposting is much more reflex based in Wild Hunt. It makes smartly swordplaying more satisfying, in any case. Signs are used for various tactical purposes, as in Assassins of Kings. Unlike in Assassins of Kings, though, you don't have to use potions before going into battle. You can use potions during battle, and I greatly enjoyed that because the way that Assassins of Kings approached tactics was not only unrealistic, but counter-intuitive as well. It makes the tactics feel more tactical and less...trying to look tactical. The side effect of this, of course, is that the game is easier than its predecessors, but just play it on a higher difficulty and you'll be fine.
On the subject of potions, another area in which Wild Hunt excels is in its alchemy system. You can't walk more than two steps without coming across an herb of some kind that can be put to some kind of use, and it makes the world feel much more at your disposal. I would have liked to have seen a little more consistency in the way that herbs look, so that I could tell an herb just by looking at it instead of going up to a bush with white flowers and finding a red flower inside, but that is a minor complaint that never actively impacted my experience. Once you have everything you need to make the kind of potion you want, you take the herbs and alcohols to an herbalist and make the potions and assign them to pockets. If you use all your potions, never fear. If you have strong alcohols in your inventory, then all your potions will be replenished when you meditate.
Picking herbs for potions is not really a chore, given the nature of the map. I, along with many others, I expect, were slightly deceived by CD Projekt Red. I, for one, was expecting a seamless open world. However, what we got was a series of massive open-world hubs. This isn't a negative, and I'm not taking points off for it, but it is not what I was expecting, and I think you should know that going in. That being said, the areas you explore in Wild Hunt are beautiful and expansive and given a jaw dropping, folky soundtrack. There were times when I found myself just riding around on my horse, listening to the operatic female vocalist vocalize with the strings, and those kinds of moments really set this game apart from other open world games (with the exception of Skyrim, of course). There is a degree of cinematic flair added to the very act of exploration that makes it really quite something.
In addition to the sheer size and beauty of the map, it is also filled with stuff to do. There are monster lairs to destroy, treasures to discover, side quests to enjoy, prisoners to free, and many other side activities. By far, my favorite side activities were the Witcher contracts. These are essentially bounties that villagers put up to get rid of monsters. In past games, it has been busy work involving killing \"x\" amounts of monsters, but in Wild Hunt it is truly intriguing. Most of the time, you don't know what the monster is until you do enough investigating. The villagers in the world of the Witcher are illiterate and uneducated, and thus, they don't know what they are dealing with. As a result, they will just give names to monsters; some fairly standard like \"shrieker,\" and others more folky, like \"Jenny-o-the-woods.\" Every contract involves investigating to find out what the monster is and then making preparations to face it before killing it. That is what being a Witcher is meant to be like, and I greatly enjoyed it. Point being, I spent a great deal of time doing side activities, and I have not, by any stretch of the imagination, done a fraction of what I can do.
Now, there is one thing I do have to admit. There is another aspect to gameplay: crafting, but I didn't ever do it, so I don't really have anything to say about it. I never really felt the need to craft because having different weapons and armor has never been really important to me in Witcher games. I'll upgrade my weaponry when I come across new weapons that are better, and the same goes for armor, but I've never had much of an investment in it. I have, however, heard good things about crafting in Wild Hunt, so I anticipate that you will probably enjoy it.
---------------------                                                           --------------------

Gwent is Wild Hunt's gambling minigame, and it is quite good. 
As you roam the map, you will undoubtedly come across something that has historically been a crippling thorn in The Witcher games' sides: gambling-based minigames. I don't remember if something like that existed in the original, but in Assassins of Kings it was some sort of dice shooting game that was boring and felt shoehorned. This is yet another area in which Wild Hunt shines. In Wild Hunt, the gambling-based minigame is \"Gwent,\" something resembling a trading card game. What sets it apart from other gambling based minigames is this: It is fun and it is customizable. I have never played an in-game gambling minigame that I have liked quite as much as Gwent (save, perhaps, for the memory game in Fable). It brings me back to my days as a Yu-Gi-Oh player, and I believe that even people without that kind of background will find it enjoyable. As you win more and more matches of Gwent, you can come across rare \"hero\" cards that give you major bonuses. You essentially get to customize and build your own deck of cards, and it becomes a compelling quest to track down rare cards. It is an easy way to make some money, and it is a compelling side activity. Wild Hunt truly sets the bar high with Gwent.
---------------------                                                           --------------------

Wild Hunt's story, though not quite traditional, is fabulous nonetheless. 
The Witcher, being based off a series of novels, is mainly about the story, so one typically goes into a Witcher game with high expectations. Before playing, I heard mixed opinions about Wild Hunt's story. Some called it the best in the series, and some called it flat and mainly filler. Having completed the story at this point, I can understand where the latter opinion might come from. Wild Hunt does not have a perfectly linear step-by-step plot. As I mentioned in the introduction, the major premise is that Geralt is looking for Ciri, his surrogate daughter, and that encompasses about 3/4 of the plot. That 3/4 mainly consists of doing missions for people in exchange for information, so on the surface, it is understandable that one might view it as filler. Here's the thing: if it is filler, it is good filler. One thing that Assassins of Kings absolutely did right was its cinematography, and Wild Hunt takes that exceptional aspect and brings it up to a whole other level. In the \"filler\" portions of the plot, you meet complex characters and come into contact with emotional situations, and they are framed in a way that is completely immersive. I was actually surprised by how often Wild Hunt made me feel its situations.
Part of this effect is due to Wild Hunt's phenomenal voice acting. I don't normally associate good voice acting with Geralt of Rivia, because he is a gravelly voiced mutant who doesn't feel much emotion. However, in Wild Hunt, his voice actor delivers the same gravelly voice in a way that goes above and beyond the Geralt of Rivia that we're used to. Even the smallest of characters is acted professionally, and this makes the world feel much more living than other open world RPGs.
Another reason that this world feels so alive is the way it is presented visually. This is the best looking game I've ever played. Period. The PS4 really struts its stuff in Wild Hunt by way of gorgeous orange sunsets and faces with realistic amounts of wrinkles.
The bottom line about Wild Hunt's presentation is this: It is masterful. There is a point in the story that I won't spoil, but that I have to discuss. The Witcher is an action genre. There is a lot of explosion and swords flinging and magic, and the plot is always equally actiony. However, there is a point in Wild Hunt where CD Projekt Red strands us in total silence, forcing us to sit there and look a major plot development in the eye. It is a moment where we see a side of Geralt of Rivia that we've never seen before, and it is handled flawlessly. With Wild Hunt, CD Projekt Red has shown that they not only know how to tell a compelling story, but how to present it as well.
---------------------                                                           --------------------

The romantic aspect of Wild Hunt is tasteful and varied. 
It wouldn't be a Witcher game if I didn't talk about romance. I'm happy to say that it is handled much more maturely in Wild Hunt than in Assassins of Kings. In Assassins of Kings, there were brothels in every. single. town. Nudity and sex were thrown in every chance possible. Women were giggly and couldn't keep a shirt on for the life of them and it really made the game seem more like a teenage boy's idea of what the medieval ages were like. In Wild Hunt, however, Geralt is older and no longer has to find comfort in the arms of cheap women. Instead, he is more than fine with the number of romance options presented to him, not the least of which are 1) Yennefer, his lover from the novels, who feels slighted by his relationship with 2) Triss Merigold, the love interest from Assassins of Kings. Regardless of which love interest you choose, the...um...scenes...are handled tastefully. It still isn't the kind of thing that I would want anyone to walk in on, but if you, like me, live with a family, then you can rest assured in the knowledge that the chances of young eyes walking in and seeing something they shouldn't are much smaller. Every romance option is different and has different resolutions. I chose to remain loyal to Triss Merigold in Wild Hunt, and from what I've heard, her romantic subplot is quite different from others.
---------------------                                                           --------------------

Ciri is a strong character both in a character development sense and just in a plain old strength sense. 
While we're on the subject of women, I think I ought to mention Ciri a little bit more. As Geralt uncovers information about Ciri's whereabouts, you switch perspectives and play as Ciri in flashbacks. As a child of the elder blood, Ciri is a powerful being, and these sections allow you to experience the power of the elder blood for yourself. Normally, and especially in Witcher games, playing as someone other than the protagonist is a chore. Playing as Ciri, on the other hand, is an entirely different experience that feels powerful and grants you the opportunity to form a connection to Ciri. This makes it so that, if you haven't read the novels, you get some sense of why this woman is so important.
---------------------                                                           --------------------

The only truly negative aspect of Wild Hunt's story is its ending. 
As I mentioned, 3/4 of the plot is Geralt looking for Ciri, and I can't explain the rest of the plot in good conscience, but let me say this: It builds and builds and builds...and then sputters. This sputtering happens in the last 5 or so minutes of the game. Five minutes before the end of the game, we are presented with about 5 different new plot points that have not once been mentioned over the course of the saga. They were evidently mentioned in the novels, but I have not read the novels, so I wouldn't know. That is one point that I do have to mention: if you haven't read the novels, you will be a little bit lost. I didn't read, though, and my constant state of not quite knowing everything being talked about never detracted from my experience (which is saying something, I must say). Point being, the ending relies heavily on the player's knowledge of the lore, and if you don't know it, you will be very confused and disappointed. Even if you do know it, however, I expect that you will still be disappointed, as these new plot points appear in seconds and are resolved just as quickly. You know what is strange about that, though? It didn't stick with me. I wasn't angry about the lackluster ending. This is probably because the entire journey was good enough to cancel it out. My biggest qualm with Wild Hunt was its ending, but the 3/4 of the plot where Geralt is locating Ciri as well as most of the remain 1/4 are good enough to sweep the ending under the rug.
---------------------                                                           --------------------

This is the collector's edition, but the regular edition still has a lot of this stuff. 
There is one final area where Wild Hunt shines, and that is in what it stands for. I don't mean the plot, I mean the game itself as a thing. CD Projekt Red has taken steps that no game developer has taken in a long time: really giving us our money's worth. The physical copy of the game, the REGULAR edition, comes with: the game, a full map of the game world, stickers, the game manual (when was the last time you saw a game manual?) and the soundtrack. In addition, everyone who owns the game gets a number of DLCs absolutely for free whenever they happen to come out. In a world where Peter Molyneux tries to charge you to get black hair dye in-game and where EA constantly sells you DLC ripped from the game for $15, this is a welcome and progressive change that hopefully sets an example for game developers in the future. With Wild Hunt, CD Projekt Red has put their money where their mouth is in terms of saying that their priority is the gamer. They truly went above and beyond the call of duty with all of the content they include with Wild Hunt.
---------------------                                                           --------------------

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a privilege to play. 
So, as I've mentioned, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is not without its flaws. Few games exist without flaws, and thus it is up to the game developers to craft something so memorable, so fulfilling, that it makes the gamer completely disregard its shortcomings. Wild Hunt was an experience that I would legitimately call a privilege. Few games I've seen come with such consistently strong character development, cinematography, gameplay, storytelling, and rewards for exploration. Not only that, but this is a game that makes an important stand for giving us our money's worth. Not only do we get the massive game that is Wild Hunt, but we also get a massive amount of other physical things as well as additional content to this already massive game once said content comes out. For as long as I've been reviewing, I've been pretty liberal with my masterpiece seal. That is something I'm going to be working on in the near future, but I hardly need to change my standards for Wild Hunt. Wild Hunt is a game made up entirely from ambition and passion, both of which consistently pay off. The game is already fantastic, but this ambition and passion are visible throughout the entirety of it, and that makes it something truly special. Wild Hunt goes above and beyond in just about every way, and it is truly a once in a lifetime experience.

Well, for one thing, everything that GTA has a bad rap for depends on the player. There is only as much sex and indiscriminate murder as you want, which means that I had a pretty vanilla experience. There is a lot to talk about with GTA V, so let's get to it.
---------------------                                                           --------------------

Gameplay is fast-paced and more of a narrative tool.
The first thing I'd like to discuss is the gameplay. If you have ever played a game by Rockstar, then you should know what to expect. There is heavy auto-aim, and your aiming reticle is a small white dot. Really, combat is just a way to get from one thing to another, which isn't a problem, because it feels powerful. You have a variety of weapons at your disposal, none of which are incredibly special, but that doesn't matter much. You are sometimes faced with hundreds upon hundreds of enemies, but it is always manageable. Grand Theft Auto V is not meant to be a challenging game, so the combat is mostly there to move the plot forward, but it is still fun.
There is a lot to do in Los Santos. There are many hobbies and pastimes such as golf, movie screenings, races, amusement park rides, etc. In addition to the main missions, there are also side missions specific to each character, and each of these side missions introduces a side character and serves to flesh out the world of GTA V even more than usual. Whether it is Franklin's junkie relative, one of Michael's old flames, or one of Trevor's trailer park neighbors, each of the side mission side characters sheds a little more light on what the world of GTA V is like outside of the main plot.
The main plot missions, however, stand just fine on their own.
There is a lot of variety in the main story of GTA V, so much so that it can sometimes seem overwhelming. Like any Rockstar game, this is a long, long, long game, so story missions range from the mundane to the unbelievably elaborate. At the core of GTA's story missions are the heists: giant coordinated criminal escapades that I have heard described as operating just on the edge of possibility. That is, things are sometimes a little too convenient to be realistic, but it is never quite unrealistic either. Each of the heists are long endeavors that offer a variety of ways to go. Depending on your choices, heists will play out in entirely different ways, and I definitely enjoyed feeling like my experience was entirely dependent on my choices.
Another aspect of gameplay is customization: each character has a specific style, but you can get different haircuts and beards, tattoos, and clothing to make them look different within those styles. Even though GTA V does not depend much on customization, I appreciated having the opportunity to take the game's visuals into my own hands at times.
There is, however, one problem that I have with this giant, vibrant world. It suffers from that classic Rockstar emptiness. Yes, there is a lot of life in Los Santos. There are lots of people and businesses and radio stations to make this world feel living and fleshed out. But the entire time I was playing GTA V, I couldn't shake the feeling of scriptedness (this problem was also present in Red Dead Redemption and LA Noir). That is to say, even though this is very much a living world, the only ways you can really, really engage with the city are through specific hobbies and pastimes that are available at specific points. The only buildings you can enter are gas stations, clothing stores, and maybe one other type of place, but I was never able to go anywhere other than gas stations and clothing stores. I definitely understand that it would be difficult beyond my wildest dreams to actually program an entire city with lots of different areas to walk in, but I would have at least liked to have explored some of the many, many, many different, cool-looking businesses that are in Los Santos. The lack of interactivity made most of Los Santos feel like it was there just for the sake of being there, and I know for a fact that this game is better than that. There were so many places to go to and all of them were unique and looked like they took a lot of thought to create, but once I got to them, there was nothing to do. Here's the bottom line: Some people make their own fun in GTA V by gunning people down, some people make their own fun in GTA V by trying to skydive onto skyscrapers. The way that I wanted to make my own fun in GTA V was by exploring this painstakingly created world that Rockstar has made, but I was very disappointed in that regard. Other than this complaint about the map however, the map and gameplay aspects of GTA V were pretty solid.
---------------------                                                           --------------------

Driving feels too flimsy and too stiff at different times.
Of course, gameplay for a game with the word \"Auto\" in the title would be nothing without driving, and unfortunately, GTA V is a little flimsy here. I've heard that GTA V's driving is better than past GTA games, but I think that there is still plenty of room for improvement. Driving feels too flimsy and at the same time too stiff. Most of the time, your turns are almost impossible to make because the cars simply do not turn reliably, but at the same time, the slightest swerve sends you into a spinning frenzy. As the game progressed, I found this less distracting, but it was ever present.
As bad as the car driving sometimes is, it is nothing compared to how flying planes and helicopters is. I understand that in real life, these things are hard to operate, but what is the point of building up your flying skill to 100% if planes and helicopters are still going to act like scared deer strapped to bottle rockets? Like the cars, the air transportation is too flimsy and at the same time too swift. In a helicopter, it feels like you are making no progress at all, ever. But at the same time, when you need to pick something up or hover directly over something, the slightest touch of the thumbstick practically puts your helicopter on the other end of the map. Likewise, in a plane, turning feels like just about the slowest thing in the world, but if you turn the thumbstick then it is almost impossible to balance the darn thing out.
One positive aspect of the cars in GTA V is the customization. There are hundreds upon hundreds of different ways to customize cars that you steal...I mean have. Everything from color to engine type to license plate type to one of the thousands of tire types is available for you to choose from. In my playthrough of GTA V, I spent thousands of dollars customizing every car I could find...which leads me to the negative side of this.
There are garages for you to save cars in, but I could never quite make it work the way I wanted it to. What I was expecting was that you could leave the car out in the world but come back to it in the garage, but that never happened in my playthrough. Maybe my copy is bugged, because that doesn't really make any sense, but regardless, it was very hard to keep ahold of the cars that I had spent so much money customizing. Especially given the fact that most of the story missions involve you having to get into a different car at some point, the lack of a convenient way to save your cars really took away from my personal experience.

Left: Michael, Middle: Franklin, Right: Trevor.
Now for the story. Grand Theft Auto V revolves around three characters. The first character is Michael DeSanta, a retired criminal who is going through an early midlife crisis. Michael lives with his family: His wife, Amanda, his son, Jimmy, and his daughter, Tracy. His entire family is about as debauched as it gets, and he finds himself struggling to remain in control. I will talk a little bit more about the DeSanta family later on, because it ties directly into what this game is really about. The second is Franklin Clinton, a younger man from the hood who is trying to break out of the gang lifestyle and aspires to greater things. Franklin works as a \"repo\" man who works with a scheming car salesman. Everybody around him takes pride in being a gang banger doing gang banger things, but Franklin wants to be something greater than that. I will also talk a little more about this later. The third is Trevor Philips, the face of this game. Trevor is unpredictable and psychotic. He is a Canadian who thinks that people are being racist when they even remotely bring up Canada. There is a lot to Trevor's character, but I won't get into that because it will spoil some of the story. Ultimately, there is a lot to each of the three protagonists, as we should have come to expect from Rockstar at this point. I was pleasantly surprised by how well the three protagonist system worked. My expectation was that having three different protagonists to switch between in such an open, customizable world would be too much to handle and would take away focus from the game, but Rockstar proved me wrong there. Yes, it is sometimes hard to keep track of each character's skills, cars, weapons, and articles of clothing, but most of the time, the story remains focused even though you play as three different characters.
The story itself is one that I can't say much about, but as we have come to expect from Rockstar, it is a story that is well thought-out and that relies heavily on characters and the relationships between them. The entire story was pretty much based on the connections between Franklin, Michael, and Trevor, as well as the connections between these characters and other characters. Because it is such a well done character-driven story, it is a darn strong story. Like I've said, there isn't much I can say without spoiling, so you're just going to have to take my word for it here.
---------------------                                                           --------------------

You'll notice the skanky clothing, the picture on the wall, the bong in the corner, the unbelievably violent game this guy is playing, the magazine at the bottom of the picture, and the middle finger this guy is giving his sister. This is how Rockstar calls out the millennial generation. 
The thing that I love about Rockstar games is that every game they make is really about something. Red Dead Redemption was about America's struggle to bring order to a wild frontier. L.A. Noir was about how horribly America treats its veterans. Grand Theft Auto IV (which I didn't play) was about the myth of the American dream. No matter what game it is, there is always some sort of theme of the dark sides of this country. Grand Theft Auto V is no exception. GTA V is about the blatant materialism and moral degradation that the millennial generation is known for, as well as the strong and damaging sense of isolated identity that is present in gang culture.
The first half of the message, the millennial culture message, is delivered primarily in Michael's story. His two children, Jimmy and Tracy, sum up the entirety of the dark sides of my generation. Jimmy is a wannabe gangster who hasn't worked a day in his life. He plays supremely violent video games, is heavily invested in porn, constantly smokes weed, and does nothing but sit, eat, and call people he plays against in his game \"hermaphrodudes.\" Tracy is a starry-eyed, fame-obsessed girl with nothing between her ears and who is as impressionable as they come. A few missions have you retrieving Tracy from a yacht that porn is being videoed in, retrieving her from a \"destroy America's self esteem\" talent TV show audition, all of which end with Tracy telling her father that he has ruined her life. Both Tracy and Jimmy are just about the most disrespectful, materialistic brats you can imagine. Michael is not the best father in the world by any stretch of the imagination, though. In fact, he is meant to be a statement about modern parenting techniques. When Tracy is being objectified and is putting herself out in front of cameras for fame, somebody asks Michael, \"How can you sleep at night knowing your daughter is being treated this way?\" Michael responds with, \"When you raise a daughter in this day and age, you just have to expect it.\" That is millennial parenting (meaning, by those who raised a lot of millennials) at its most potent. Michael is meant to represent the ambivalence that modern parenting is loaded with as well as the \"never tell a child 'no'\" approach to parenting. Only when Michael starts taking control of his life again and starts to intervene more does his family show any signs of improvement.
The second half of this game's overall message, the gang culture message, is delivered in Franklin's story. At the beginning of the game, Franklin works for a car salesman named Simeon. Simeon charges outlandish interest on cars, and when the customer inevitably can no longer pay, Franklin and his best friend, Lamar, go out and steal back the cars. Franklin, having grown up in the ghettos of Los Santos, has been a criminal all his life to keep from starving, but he wants to aspire to greater things. Everybody around him, however, is so caught up in being part of the hood and reliving the glory days of gang culture that they don't share his ambition. They are all content to continue to live in the hood and be gang bangers. Franklin is threatened with violence on a number of occasions because his fellow hoodlums believe that he is going \"soft\" on them, that he is putting the Rockford hills kind of culture ahead of his hood family. The gang culture that Rockstar presents us with in Franklin's story is one that pretty much resembles real life: it is a cycle of \"us and them.\" There are two worlds in this kind of mindset: The hood and the rest of the world. Many of those involved in gang culture could probably escape the constant threat of suddenly being killed, but the sense of family is stronger than the fear of death. This is the kind of cycle that Rockstar is criticizing in Franklin's story. There are a number of conversations that Franklin has with Lamar that bring this theme up. There is a mission in which you, playing as Franklin, rescue Lamar from a group of Ballers who have kidnapped him and are planning on killing him. Upon rescuing him, Lamar doesn't even offer a note of thanks. Instead, when asked about this near-death experience, Lamar says that, \"this is the hood. This is what happens, and I'm the kind of person it happens to.\" Franklin is constantly offering Lamar options in his own higher escapades, options that would help Lamar get out of the ghetto and out of the life of violence, but Lamar constantly refuses. Truly, Rockstar made a grand statement when they wrote Franklin's story. Instead of thanking Franklin for rescuing him, Lamar berates him for leaving the hood behind, and it is a brilliant criticism of modern gang culture.
---------------------                                                           --------------------

The achievement for choosing to use the water torture is called, \"its legal.\" Makes you think.
Now I'd like to take some time to talk about the portion of GTA V that really, really put it under fire: the torture sequence. This sequence plays into the overarching theme of pretty much all of Rockstar's games: The government is evil. In Red Dead Redemption, they kidnap protagonist John Marston's wife and child and threaten to kill them if he doesn't commit a few murders on their behalf. In L.A. Noir, they let known killers and child rapists walk free because of the connections they have. And in Grand Theft Auto V, Rockstar points a finger at all the dumb Americans who think that torture is ever justified and tells them, \"ok, you do it, then!\" In this scene, one of the game's villains, a charismatic white guy who wears a purple polo shirt and khakis and works for the government, tells you to torture an innocent man who just so happens to know things about a person who the government believes is a threat to national security. Here's the kicker though: the guy never actually needs any convincing to talk. He is willing to talk right from the get go. The government guy, however, withholds certain details of what he wants to know, thus making you torture him for a little while. After a bit of torture is applied, the government guy adds an important detail to what he wants to know in and acts like he has been asking that question from the beginning. (\"Now, are you going to tell me about X, or do we have to go again?\" \"Why didn't you just say so? I know about X!\") You torture this American citizen four times in total, and every single time, you have to go over to a table and choose a method of torture: water torture, pulling a tooth, breaking a limb with a wrench, or electric clips to the nipples. You. Have. No. Choice. In order to proceed, you have no choice but to choose a method and deliver it, all the while with the guy begging you to stop and saying that he is an American citizen. After you have finished torturing him for the fourth time, the smiling purple polo white guy leaves and tells you to kill him. Instead, you untie him and send him on a plane to a faraway country to be a torture advocate.
Grand Theft Auto is no stranger to controversy, but this section really pushed the boundaries. The countless people who try to get bills into the senate to ban violent video games see this section at a surface level and say, \"oh, GTA is promoting torture.\" But all it takes is a little bit of thought to see what this section actually is. With the torture section, Rockstar games opens up a discussion of an evil that is very much present in modern America. America has been torturing for years, and very few people (and zero presidents, democrats and republicans alike) have done anything to stop it. This section has you use some of the methods that our government uses (the achievement for using the water torture is called, \"its legal\"). It really shows how full of it a lot of people really are, because while they look down on this section as promoting torture, these same people are the kind of people who see the released C.I.A. torture reports and cheer them on. As a Libertarian, I am a half conservative, and in general I lean more to that side of things, but the utter hypocrisy of a lot of conservative politicians really astounds me sometimes. They'll go out of their way to try and erase simulated violence no matter what the message of it is, but when this kind of senseless torture is actually happening in our country, these same politicians raise the American flag, perform a boy scout salute, and say that we do what we have to do to protect ourselves from the \"ragheads\". This is a viscerally disturbing section that forces people such as the airheads on fox news to watch a man beg for the pain to stop, and then it asks them if they still think that \"getting those ragheads\" is worth the price. Yeah, this section made me really uncomfortable, and that is the point. The point of this section is to force you to look this crime in the eyes and realize that the villains of the world are not just people wearing turbans across the ocean who occasionally kill somebody. They are, in fact, villains, but the most present, harmful villains of today are the smiley charismatic white guys who claim to be protecting us while they (provenly) torture American citizens and suspected terrorists alike.

Grand Theft Auto V is the kind of experience I've been waiting my whole gaming career for, and for the most part, it fills the role nicely. 
In the end, there is a lot to love about Grand Theft Auto V. It is a gigantic game with loads to do, even if the lack of interaction does take away from that size. The gameplay does its job well, and it is just generally fun to play, so it really goes above and beyond what it is meant to do as a narrative device. The story of Grand Theft Auto V is also lovable. It can be argued that it isn't the most realistic story in the world in terms of the things that happen on a surface level, but on a psychological level it is one of the more realistic games I've played in a while. While the actual events of the game can kind of induce a \"ehhh I don't know about that,\" the way that people interact, the way that relationships between government and citizen operate in this game are true to reality, and it is a refreshing experience. There is a lot of depth to GTA V in its statements about millennial materialism as well as the isolated identity of gang culture, but there is also a lot of depth in (as I've made a point of saying) the way it discusses the relationship between government and citizen. A constant theme throughout the game is government surveillance and personal data ownership, both of which are themes that are present in modern America. In addition, as I've said, it makes a point of discussing our country's unfortunate history of torture in a way that is absolutely gut-wrenching and thought provoking.

In other words, when I went into Grand Theft Auto V, I was expecting a good time in an open world. But what I got was an intelligently crafted dialogue about modern American society that I have been able to continuously analyze in the week or two since I completed the game. It does have its occasional weaknesses, but ultimately, Grand Theft Auto V is a game that you need to play if you want to get the most out of your life as a gamer. I believe this fervently enough that I am CHANGING MY OWN RULES in order to accommodate the score that I want to give it. The reason I need to change my own rules here is this: Grand Theft Auto V has flaws, but it is...a masterpiece.

	$review9->body = "It all started Christmas day circa 2009. One of my gifts was a game called \"Dragon Age: Origins,\" and it was one that I had heard good things about, but one that I was only mildly interested in. I was up until it was bright outside playing it. On Christmas day circa 2009, I first delved into what would become my favorite game of all time. Then, two years later, the sequel, \"Dragon Age II\" came out, and it was one of the worst games I have ever played. I started to lose my faith in the people behind Dragon Age. Was it possible that they could ever make anything that could compare to the original? That was why I was skeptical when Dragon Age: Inquisition was announced. But as Bioware continued to reveal more and more about the game, I was positively surprised by the newfound ambition they were bringing to the project, and thus, my faith in them grew once more. I forced myself to bring Dragon Age: Inquisition to a close last night (because I'm out of break time), despite having a hundred or so more things that I wanted to do. Dragon Age: Inquisition is a bold, grand new reimagining of the world of Thedas that steps out from the model we are used to in favor of a more thoroughly realized one. There are a number of hindering technical problems that I will touch on later, and they prevent this game from achieving full masterpiece status, but unless something really shocks me in the upcoming month, it is a shoe-in for my game of the year. This will be a SPOILER-FREE review, so feel free to read on if you haven't yet played the game.
---------------------                                                           --------------------

Character creation is deep and different for each race (1)
For this review, I will be trying to go in \"as they appear\" order. Meaning, I'll start by talking about character creation and go chronologically from there. In Dragon Age: Origins, you could play as a Human, Elf, or Dwarf. In Dragon Age II, you could play as...a human...and in Inquisition, Bioware has made up for the lack of choice in II by giving you not three, but four races to choose from. You can play as a Human, Elf, Dwarf, or Qunari.
For each of these races, the degree to which you are able to customize is remarkable. I have only played as an Elf thus far, but I cannot wait to see what I can do with other races. Each race has a very specific kind of look and kind of customization, so no two races will ever look too much like another one. And once you pick your race, you will truly live as that race for the rest of the game.
As the elf inquisitor, royal human courts watched my every move and refused to acknowledge the power I held, and my people greeted me with open arms. I can only imagine that the opposite would happen if I were to play as a human. Not only that, but every race has a different last name, and you will occasionally be called by it. I would walk into a royal court and be introduced as \"Grand Inquisitor Lavellan,\" which is a far cry from just being called \"Hawke\" all the time like in Dragon Age II. It also makes more sense in this case. You aren't just being called by your last name, you are called by your title and then your last name. It is a small thing, but I appreciated it, and it was a nice break from the Dragon Age II model.
Different races also occasionally come with different romance options and different kinds of armor. Gone are the days of dwarven armor being stretched to fit a human. Instead, different armor pieces are only made for certain races.
In short, character customization in Inquisition, no matter what race you chose, gives you access to an entirely different story every time. Even though the main plot is the same regardless of your race, the journey to get there is slightly different depending on your race. In some cases, you can glide through with ease because you were born human, and in some cases, you can face adversity at every turn because, as a Qunari, you were born with horns and undying devotion to the Qun. It is the kind of detailed touch that we have not had since Origins, and it is even more prominent in Inquisition than in Origins.
---------------------                                                           --------------------

Combat in Inquisition is challenging at most times, so you will need to do some thinking (2).
The next thing to discuss is combat, which was a matter of some concern in both of the previous Dragon Age games. Prepubescent boys complained that Origins didn't have enough action, that it was too strategic, while veteran RPG-ers (such as myself) were incensed at the anime-boy hack and slash nightmare that was Dragon Age II. Well, in Inquisition, we are presented with a middle ground that takes the best of both worlds and forms Bioware's strongest gameplay model from these parts.
Ultimately, it takes the action-y nature of Dragon Age II's combat, but slows it down so you aren't in a Final Fantasy game. You also have access to the \"tactical camera,\" a feature that was once a PC-exclusive for Dragon Age. It allows you to tell your party members what specifically to do at a given time, and even on casual difficulty you will need to make use of the tactical camera at some points if you want to survive.
As in previous games, you choose a class at the start: Warrior, Rogue, or Mage, and Inquisition is determined to give you the most satisfaction out of whatever class you choose. I chose to be a Rogue, and as such, I expected to be lithe and mobile and dirty in my tactics. And boy, did Bioware deliver. As a Rogue, you have access to as many as three different moves that let you swing around the battlefield quickly. You have a hook attack that involves you throwing a hook and pulling yourself towards an enemy and doing a backflip off of them. You can then use your flip ability to leap out of the way of their attacks. Then you can use your backstab ability to suddenly blink behind them. As a rogue, Bioware makes sure that you can be the rogueiest rogue that you could possibly be. I haven't played as a warrior or mage yet, but from what others tell me, you get the same kind of experience.
A brand new feature in Inquisition is \"focus.\" Essentially, as your party deals damage and kills enemies, you gain \"focus,\" and when you get enough you get to use a specific ability. It varies based on party member, so you have a wide variety of possible focus abilities at your disposal, each useful in their own ways. More often than not, it came in handy in a pinch.
A returning feature that was not present in Dragon Age II is the ability to choose what your party members wear and use as weapons. Gone are the days of needing to use Isabella if you want a rogue with two knives and Aveline if you want a warrior with sword and shield. You can choose whether a warrior in your party has a sword and shield or two-handed weapon, of whether a rogue has daggers or a bow. In addition, when you equip armor on a teammate, they will wear it, but it will be converted to \"their\" version of the armor. In other words, you can give your teammates the kinds of benefits you want without making them look odd. It is a welcome idea that works well.
I do, however, feel like I should point out the negative aspects of combat. You can't access to inventory screen while you are in combat, and thus, you need to be sure to equip whatever you want to use before you go up against enemies. This was a slight hassle, as I sometimes wanted to equip a bow in the middle of combat to change things up a bit. But it is only a slight hassle, as the higher leveled I got, the more I enjoyed just using my daggers.
Also, and this isn't truly a negative, but you have a total of 8 health potions across your entire party, and if you run out, you have to go and get them restocked. I didn't like having to turn back and go to a camp if I found I was running out of potions, which made it an issue with me. But there is an aspect of that idea that keeps it from taking any points off: It encouraged tactical thinking. The prospect of losing all my health potions made me more inclined to use the tactical camera and sacrifice doing damage in favor of not losing any health. It made large-scale boss fights more challenging and the game in general more tense.
---------------------                                                           --------------------

This is but one of the ten high dragons that you can hunt (3)
Speaking of large-scale boss fights, since it is a Dragon Age game, one fully expects there to be dragons. Unlike in the previous games, there is not just one dragon....there are ten. You read that right. 10 dragons to hunt and slay. Unlike games such as Skyrim, where there are also dragons abound, these are not the exact same dragons every time. There are 10 different species of high dragon that you can hunt down, and no two dragons have the same set of tactics, so it is an entirely different fight each time. It doesn't matter how much more highly leveled you are (I went up against a level 14 dragon when I was level 21), every dragon fight is a challenge, and you will need to think tactically if you want to survive. Whenever you enter a new area, you need to be on your toes. Sometimes you have advanced warning that you're walking into a dragon's lair, as a party member will mention that it feels like there may be a dragon nearby or something. But other times, the dragons just fly towards you from nowhere, and you have no choice but to either make a hasty retreat and hope that you don't get roasted alive on the way out, or stand and fight it. Either way, every single encounter with a dragon in Inquisition is a reminder that these are freaking dragons, and that they don't screw around.
---------------------                                                           --------------------

The world of Dragon Age: Inquisition is massive (4)
If you've played Dragon Age II, you were probably as angry as I was that you were forced to play only within the confines of a single city, whereas in Origins you played across an entire nation. Well, in Inquisition, you play across the Kingdom of Ferelden (the location of Origins) and the Empire of Orlais. It isn't an entirely open map, because no Bioware game has an entirely open map, but every. single. area of this game is HUGE. Let me put it to you this way: the very first area you are dropped in is larger than the entire playable area of Dragon Age: Origins. There are a number of areas, each of which is larger than the playable area in Origins, and each of which has its own secrets and unique quests and opportunities to discover.
Let me once again take a step back to explain something through example: My first night playing Inquisition, I did maybe one story mission, and the rest of the time (this was around 9:00pm-7:30am) I just spent doing quests and activities in the very first area you are dropped in. That is how huge this world is, and that is only one of the many, many areas available to you. I simply cannot describe how much I love the ambition and thought that went into the world building for Inquisition. Bioware took the idea of the Dragon Age world and expanded on it enough to really make it a breathing world. I thought that Thedas felt alive in Origins, but I hadn't seen anything until I played Inquisition.
Part of what makes this the case is the fact that there are no \"copy-paste\" areas. Origins had several areas that were re-used over and over again, and Dragon Age II was especially bad. But there is not a single area in this game that is re-used. There are some that look similar, yes, but none that are re-used, so everywhere feels like a new area.
I should also point out that every area on the map is seamless, unless you enter a separate dungeon. That means that if there are villages or towns in the area, there will be no loading screens before entering them. You will just walk into them. While the map is not entirely open, as I've said, the areas of the map that you can walk in are entirely seamless, and the only loading screens you need to worry about are in fast travel (and a good thing, too, but I'll touch on that later).
Yes, you read that right. Fast travel. No matter where you are (unless you're in a dungeon), you can go to your map and fast travel to the opposite side of the world. As much as I loved origins, there were times where I dreaded having to walk the entire way back to the exit so that I could fast travel. This gives Thedas a fluidity that is long overdue.
And on the topic of getting around the map, Dragon Age: Inquisition introduces mounts such as horses, harts, dracolisks (dragon-like horses), and some unique mounts as well. They are kind of a random idea, considering I didn't always think to use them out of sheer force of habit, but they were still handy when I wanted to get somewhere on the map faster.
In every area, there are regions to explore, landmarks to claim, rifts in the veil to close, quests to complete, minerals and herbs to collect, shards to find, locked doors to open, caves to explore, hidden treasures to find, and beautiful scenery to be enjoyed. I could write for pages and pages about all the things that you can do in the world of Dragon Age: Inquisition, but suffice it to say that I have 45 hours under my belt for this play through, and I haven't yet completed even a fraction of what I can do.
---------------------                                                           --------------------

The full cast of characters, Last supper-style (5)
Because Bioware makes this game, it is dangerous to go alone. Like in previous Bioware titles, you have an \"inner circle\" of sorts. You can take three of these companions with you to help you in battle (I use the word \"can\" willy-nilly here, you pretty much have to, because that is the Bioware experience), and when you aren't on the battlefield, you can talk to them and learn more about them. You can become their friend, and if the conditions are right, you can pursue a romantic relationship with one of them.
Part of what made Origins so great was the fantastic character development. Every last one of the party members you assembled was a well-formed character that I wanted to get to know better. I spent hours talking with them, learning more about them, gaining their trust. It helped with the immersion I felt with the story. In addition, part of what made Dragon Age II such a nightmare was the fact that none of the characters were well-developed. Every last character in Dragon Age II was a caricature with no substance. So, does Inquisition do a better job with that? The answer is yes and no. There are a number of incredibly well-formed characters that I took with me on every quest.
Take Blackwall, for example. When he was announced, I looked at his profile and thought, \"oh great. Another Dragon Age II style companion.\" But then, I met the dude, and I ended up taking him on every quest, because he turned out to be such a fascinating character. Like I said, there are a number of characters who are extremely interesting and well-developed...but then there are also characters who seem like they came from Dragon Age II (Ironically, Varric, who WAS in Dragon Age II, does not fit on that list).
Take Sera, for example. Sera is an elf who sounds like Bioware was looking to get Rebel Wilson but got a Rebel Wilson impersonator instead. All she does is crack jokes about her butt and talk like old people think teenagers talk like. Bioware has, without fail, had a lame character like that in every Dragon Age game. In Origins, it was Alistair (who was still well-developed, despite being lame), in II, it was Anders, and in Inquisition it is Sera. Congratulations, Bioware, your loser character is a woman this time.
But what I'm trying to say is that character development in Inquisition is hit-or-miss, hitting a lot of the time, and missing sometimes as well. Out of the 9 companions you have, I'd say that about 6 of them are well-developed. That is a majority, even though it means that 3 of them are underdeveloped.
As with previous Dragon Age titles, party banter is alive and well. I can't say I got the full scope of it, considering I had my favorite party lined up and stuck to it, but the banter within my favorite party was funny, sometimes blood-pressure raising, and sometimes touching.
---------------------                                                           --------------------

When the story begins on such a high point, you know you're in for a treat (6)
And now, the moment we've all been waiting for: The Story. Opinions have been mixed about the story. Some love it, while a lot of reviewers I've read and watched have called it vague. I did not find this to be the case, however, I must concede that the game operates under the assumption that everyone is like me and reads more of the codex and the lore than what is said out loud. The issue here is that very few people are like me in this regard, so a lot of people are not going to know what is going on for a lot of the time. It wasn't a problem in my own personal play through, because obviously, I knew the lore, but I cannot deny that it will be a problem to a lot of people. I know for a fact that, as the end of the story was approaching, I, on multiple occasions, though, \"Wow. If I hadn't read that part of the codex, I would be so confused right now.\" This is not a game that is \"accessible\" to people who have never played Dragon Age before, which I love, because \"accessible\" normally translates to \"dumbing it all the hell down and spelling things you already know out in simple terms over and over again.\" However, it is also not a game that is \"accessible\" save to the most dedicated of fans. Even though it never impacted me, that is kind of a problem. I'm not going to be taking any points off for that, but you should still make a note of it. Never before has the degree to which I sacrifice the prospect of ever marrying and having children by knowing so much about a fictional universe made so much of a difference. Without spoiling anything, if you are going to play this game, I would recommend reading codex entries about the following: The Darkspawn, the Tevinter Imperium, Elven Religion (gods and goddesses, practices, etc.), and the Fade. You will be much better equipped to process the story if you are informed on these matters.
All of that being said, the story for Dragon Age: Inquisition is phenomenal, cinematic, and it kept me on my toes, hanging off of every line of dialogue in the events leading up to the end. The premise is this: After the events of Dragon Age II (Anders blowing up the chantry to show that mages and templars can never be at peace...Why on earth am I still single?), a year has passed, and the mages and templars are meeting with Divine Justinia of the chantry in a conclave to discuss the future of the magic problem. You are involved in the conclave in some way, depending on your race, and you don't know what happened, but you end up walking out of the fade (the demon realm) and being arrested for the murder of the divine. You learn that a giant explosion tore a hole in the sky, and that hole leads to the fade. Demons are spewing out of the rift in the sky, and the Inquisition, an organization formed by the Divine before she was killed, is working to find a way to close it. You eventually begin working with the Inquisition, and find that you are opposed by the Venatori, essentially the KKK for the racial purity of the Tevinter Imperium, and that the Venatori serve a self-proclaimed deity known as \"The Elder One,\" a being of darkness that is, as a victim of his says, \"m...more p.p.powerful than the Maker,\" (or God, for those of you who are unfamiliar with the lore).
And that is about all I can say about the story without spoiling anything. But this is a story in which you will mingle with nobility, pass judgment and make difficult decisions, and take down hordes upon hordes of demons.
Once again, I cannot stress how important it is to be knowledgable in the right areas. If you are like me, and you are knowlegable in the right areas, then you will leave the ending and the post-credits scene of Inquisition shaking from nerd joy. If you can understand it, and you do have the means to do so, then the end of Inquisition and the implications that it has for the future of Dragon Age will stun you and leave you thinking about it for days to come.
---------------------                                                           --------------------

It will take the game about ten seconds to reach even a fraction of this texture quality (7)
Now that I've gotten everything positive out of the way (you'll note that going in chronological order helps me get everything positive out of the way), I must touch upon the negatives of Dragon Age: Inquisition. As much as I hate to ever rag on graphics (especially considering that Origins' graphics were pretty dated for their time), I must do so here. All of the screenshots and clips of this game that were used prior to its release were for next-gen consoles, which I don't own. I got the Xbox 360 copy of this game, and the degree of graphical downgrade is shocking and unnerving to say the least. For the entirety of the prologue, graphics were horrible and looked a lot like Origins (meaning, five years old at this point). Now, after the prologue, graphics improve greatly for some reason. I don't know why. Maybe I got used to it, or maybe it is just an issue with the prologue, but after the prologue, the bad graphics are no longer there.
However, the absolutely horrendous texture pop-in never quite went away. In just about every cutscene, it would take somewhere upwards of five seconds for all the texture layers to show-up. I can't count the number of times I've had to watch story events unfold in basic texturing. In other games, it is only a minor annoyance, but in Inquisition it is a constant battle. How so much of it can be so easily overlooked is beyond me. More often than not, I couldn't even focus on the story event at hand because something new would be popping in every two seconds. That is just not a mistake that one can afford to make in a triple-A game.
As bad as the texture pop-in and the graphical downgrade was, it wasn't nearly as bad as what I call the \"what is my life\" glitch. The \"what is my life\" glitch first pops up about halfway through the story, when you team up with a familiar character to go talk to some gray wardens in the Western approach. What this glitch does is this: A character will deliver a line of dialogue, and then he will just stare off into space. The cutscene will not move along, and the only way to get out of it is to skip dialogue. As a result, you miss important details. And you know what else? This glitch happens exclusively in story missions, sometimes in really, really important spots. There are some things I don't know because I've had to deal with this glitch so many times. It always happens at the same times, and I don't understand how it was possible for Bioware to overlook this glitch.
There were also several audio bugs. In just about every fight, there were sound effects that were missing, and in many lines of dialogue, the voice-over would get screwed up, and it would sound like my character was speaking gibberish.

The veil has been torn, and the result is perhaps the best game of this year (6)
So, all in all, what do I think about Dragon Age: Inquisition? Is it better than II? Of course it it, but that isn't a high bar to set. Perhaps a better and more dangerous question to ask is: Is it better than Origins? And I have a dangerous answer to that question: Yes and no. There are some aspects of Inquisition that are inarguably better than Origins. Such aspects are: Gameplay, exploration, cinematography, and world-building. However, Origins still reigns supreme in areas such as: Character development, storytelling, immersion, dramatic tension, and bug checking. In other words, Origins is still the superior game, but it is a close contest. It is legitimately a close call because Inquisition does so many things better than Origins did. However, when it comes right down to it, Inquisition failed to meet Origins in quality in a few places. I'm about to give Inquisition its score, and it is going to look like I have disregarded all of the negatives that I have mentioned, but that is not the case. I want nothing more than to give this game a \"Masterpiece\" seal in addition to the score I'm going to give it, but there are simply too many technical problems that legitimately take away from the experience for me to grant that seal in good conscience. Instead, I will be giving it the next best thing. Dragon Age: Inquisition takes the world that I love so much and expands on literally every aspect of it, making it a more living world. It has the best gameplay of any Bioware game, it tells a fascinating story, and it has a number of well-developed characters. It felt like the race you choose to play as makes a difference, and the world in which you spend all of your time is engaging, large, and beautiful. All in all, to say it a different way, Dragon Age: Inquisition is a masterwork in all things save for technical quality, which prevents it from earning a masterpiece seal. But despite the many technical problems, Dragon Age: Inquisition was an experience to rival Origins, and it is the kind of expansive, massive Dragon Age game that I have been wanting for years.
10/10

	$review10->body = "The first season of Telltale Games' episodic game series, \"The Walking Dead,\" holds a special place in my heart. The tale of Lee and Clementine's journey across Georgia was a heartwarming, heartbreaking, and heartcrushing experience whose ending holds the spot for #1 most depressing ending in the gaming world. I have played it more times than I can count on my hands, but it still causes two or three lines of water to run down my face. So, when the trailer for the first episode of a second season came out about a year ago, I had mixed feelings. On one hand, I had faith in Telltale's ability to tell a compelling story, but on the other one, I wondered if they could tell as compelling a story with Clementine as the protagonist instead of a supporting character. I mean, part of what made the first season so great was the presence of Clementine as somebody you cared for. The best part of season one was the fact that it was about taking care of her. So, when I heard that instead of keeping Clementine safe, I was going to be playing as Clementine, I was a little bit skeptical. But, while not as strong as the first season, Season 2 of \"The Walking Dead\" proves to be a potent, emotional experience. As you know, when you have something negative to say, it produces a lot more words than when you have positive things to say, so it is really going to look like I am slamming this season, but know that I do not feel as negatively about this season as it is going to appear. Let's get started.
---------------------                                                          ---------------------

Clementine is back, and just as adorable as ever (1).
Now, it is Telltale's \"The Walking Dead,\" so I'm going to talk about the most important aspect first: Clementine. The thing that absolutely blows my mind about this season is the way in which Telltale matures Clementine. The way that they write Clementine, and the way she is acted in this season, makes her seem like she is the same person, but matured. Season 2 starts off a little over a year after the events of the first season, so Clementine is now either 10 or 11. She isn't as little a kid as she was, and it shows. The way she speaks indicates that jump in age, and Melissa Hutchison (her voice actress) does a fantastic job of ever-so-slightly lowering her voice for this season. While I much prefer the cute, innocent Clementine of Season 1, I loved the fact that they made Clementine more of a fleshed out character in this season. Throughout the entirety of the season, we get insights into Clementine's character that we couldn't get if we were still wanting to pinch her cheeks. Another thing I appreciated about this season's approach to Clementine was the \"multiple shades of the same color\" character branching. What I mean by this is that Clementine would be pretty much the same kind of character no matter what choices you make, but the choices you make would determine which particular kind of that kind of character she would be. Does that make sense? Like, if Clementine is the color gray, then you get to decide whether she is a lighter shade or a darker shade. She will be gray either way, but she will be different within that color. Thats the only way I can think to put it. Clementine has always been a relatable character for me because of the volunteer work that I do. I live in a dormitory at my college campus that revolves around community service, and every week for the past two years I have gone and volunteered at my local children's shelter. Every week, I interact/play with/read to/help children who have escaped or have been rescued from abusive households (of all kinds, as I have had the misfortune of learning). As a result of this, the Clementine character has always struck a particularly strong note in my heart. I have known a few little girls who have seen things nearly as horrible as Clementine has seen, and I knew one particular girl who looked uncannily like her. While I do prefer the cuter, more innocent Clementine of season 1, I definitely related more to the Season 2 Clementine. Why? Because she acts and talks like real girls who have been through this kind of hell. She acts and talks like she is one of the kids I interact with every week. I simply cannot praise Telltale Games enough for the realistic way in which they crafted this more mature Clementine. But, I suppose that is enough ranting and personal anecdote for this review. Simply put, Clementine, as always, is the greatest gift that video gaming has ever given mankind. She still manages to be just about the cutest little thing ever, but she is a more hardened, more mature cutest little thing ever.

Characters in this season, despite being well-fleshed out, aren't incredibly compelling (2).
Now, part of what made Season 1 such a huge success was the cast of characters. Each of them was strong and well-written, so they all came together to make the story more believable and more relatable. While character development is still at an all-time high in Season 2, I never quite felt attached to any of the characters, save for one who appears in the second episode. Do you understand what I'm saying? The characters were fantastic and well-developed. But despite that, I never even remotely felt attached to them. I never once was sad when any of them died. Seriously, the only characters I ever got attached to were ones introduced after the first episode. Deaths that should have been absolutely devastating were just...meh...and that is a problem. All of the characters introduced (save for one) in the first episode felt like filler characters, like characters who only exist to die so that major characters don't have to die...and given how these were the major characters, you can see where the conflict lies. There was one character in the first episode who I bonded with, but then he was dead by the end of the episode regardless of the choices I made, so until the better characters were brought in, all I was left with were the characters I didn't particularly care about. And that brings me to another qualm I have with this season: choices. A lot of people complained that the choices in the first season had no impact. But that simply isn't the case. In the first season, in the short run, the game could be entirely different based on the choices you made, and new conflicts could arise based on them. But in this season, it legitimately felt like nothing I ever did mattered. Characters would get mad at me and be over it a few lines of dialogue later. Now, I learned a few play throughs later that there are certain choices you can make that will get certain characters killed off quicker. But, here's the thing: the choices required to make these kinds of differences are vague, things you wouldn't think of. And when you do make those choices, not much changes at all. Characters and Choices were my biggest peeves with this season. Characters were strong, but uninteresting. And choices were numerous, but until the final episode (in which choices reeeeaally made a difference), they didn't mean a thing.
---------------------                                                          ---------------------

Carver is the kind of villain that the Walking Dead has needed (3).
While we are on the subject of characters, I owe it to y'all to discuss the antagonists of this season. There are two of them. The first one, Carver, is going to earn a high place on the \"best villains\" list this year. Not only is he just a well fleshed-out character, he is also a crazy villain with no motivation who doesn't seem like a crazy villain with no motivation. The way he acts, you'd think Clementine and the group killed his puppy. If the Governor from the TV show were a strong villain, then this is what he would be like. The other antagonist, who I will not name, is not necessarily a villain. But regardless, I hated him with every fiber of my being, as he constantly shows up to get people killed. Throughout the time he is in the game, people are constantly trying to make life easier on him, but he is just a vile human being. Granted, he does have reason to be a vile human being, but some of the things he does in the season finale are jaw-droppingly vile. These characters along with Clementine and the characters brought in after episode 1 are what saved the Walking Dead Season 2 from flopping in terms of characters.
---------------------                                                          ---------------------

Well...you'll read my thoughts on the story (4). 
Now, I've discussed characters, choices, and Clementine, which means I have covered almost everything. But there is still one thing left to discuss, and it is the second most important thing in Telltale's \"The Walking Dead\", the story. Unfortunately, I do have to point out a few negatives in this category. Yet another thing that contributed to the fact that the first season was such a triumph was the fact that every episode felt complete in and of itself. There may not have been a huge plot starting off, but every episode had its own story, and by the end of each episode, that story felt complete. That is not even remotely the case with Season 2. With Season 2, it is obvious that Telltale was going for a different approach, that they were trying to make it so that there was one overarching plot instead of several smaller ones leading up to a big one. It was an admirable effort, but it wasn't entirely successful for a number of reasons.
The first reason is that not every episode felt complete. Even if Telltale was trying to just have one plot, it is unavoidable that every episode would be viewed as its own section of that one plot. As such, the smart thing to do would have been to make every episode cover a section of the plot that made sense. They could still have left every episode on a cliffhanger, but if they had done this, then every episode would have felt full. The entire time I was playing, I got this overwhelming sense that every episode I was playing was just there so we could get to the end. I felt like every twist and turn was just there so we could get to the ending in a certain way. In Season 1, like in this season, we were headed towards the ending from the very beginning (because the guy who came up with this particular story had the ending figured out before anything else), but it didn't feel like it. That is one of my major qualms with the storytelling in Season 2. It feels like they had the ending figured out first, and while there isn't anything wrong with a story being conceived that way (I do it all the time), the key to good storytelling is to make every second feel like it counts. The key is to make the ending just that: the ending. The ending will oftentimes be the best part, but the key is to keep the rest of the story from feeling like a shadow. Hopefully that wasn't too dense, or too confusing. I just really, really have a hard time not noticing these types of things, being a creative writer myself.
The second reason is that there really didn't seem to be much change within the story. Without spoiling anything, here is a breakdown of season 1: Episode 1: cop car, suburban neighborhood, farm, drugstore, motor inn. Episode 2: Georgia countryside, motor inn, dairy, enemy camp, meat locker, another bit of countryside. Episode 3: drugstore, motor inn, R.V., side of the road, R.V., train, train station. Episode 4: Savannah streets, mansion, riverfront, sewers, morgue, survivor community, mansion. Episode 5: morgue, rooftops, mansion, another mansion, different rooftops, river street, hotel, storefront, countryside. Without spoiling anything, here is a breakdown of season 2: Episode 1: pine forest and log cabin. Episode 2: pine forest and ski lodge (log cabin). Episode 3: enemy camp. Episode 4: Civil war site, trailer park, freezing countryside. And I won't say anything about Episode 5's breakdown, because that would actually spoil some things. But hopefully you can see my point. In season 1, there was tons of variety in every episode, whereas in season 2 every episode has roughly the same scenery and locations. There weren't any huge shocks in the story, so what we have is a story that pretty much just exists, and this existing story takes place in roughly the same area for all but its final chapter. It is a story that doesn't really change at all until the end. 
The third and final reason is that the story itself just wasn't very good. Now, the finale is the exception, but I will dig deeper into that in a moment. As I mentioned at the end of the second reason, there aren't very many shocks, not a lot of unpredictable things happen. Normally, that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Stories don't need twists and turns to be good. But if your story is basically, \"they walked here, they walked there, they met this person, this person died, they walked here,\" then a twist or two couldn't hurt. If there is no breaking of trust, no true, changing conflict between characters no matter what circumstances arise, then what is the point? Story is conflict. Period. And the characters in this season exist in a perpetual state of \"between conflicted and harmonious,\" which would be a good thing if it meant there was tension. Characters would occasionally argue, but it never quite felt organic. It just felt like the writers said, \"we'll put an argument here.\" Basically, what I'm trying to say is this: as much as it pains me to say it, until the finale, the story for Season 2 was just plain flat and uninteresting. Not even fleshed-out (though not entirely compelling) characters, returns of some characters, fantastic voice acting, fantastic art, fantastic gameplay, and a more relatable Clementine could save this season's story from its own mediocrity. Now, having heard me say that, I bet you're wondering why I would bother to give you a disclaimer about not feeling as negative as I sound at the beginning of this review. Well, let me tell you why. All those fantastic aspects of this game couldn't save the story from mediocrity, but in the end, there is one thing that did end up saving it.
---------------------                                                          ---------------------

The finale is truly a masterpiece (5). 
Episode 5: No Going Back, the Season Finale. This is what saves the season, this is what rescues its mediocre story from really getting verbally crucified, this is what makes the formerly non compelling characters into something more, this is what makes the art even more beautiful, this is what makes the voice acting even more masterful, this is what makes even Clementine better than she already is. Episode 5: No Going Back is the defining episode of this season, and it washes this season of nearly every sin it has racked up. I'm going to need a few paragraphs, so I'll break it down by aspect.
Art: The art style in Episode 5 is the same style, but it is handled in such a way that I could feel this huge weight on my shoulders like depression, like the cold that the group was experiencing. There was just this overwhelming sense of sadness and the bleakness of life, and in the one happy segment in this episode, the art made the happiness truly feel like an island in the middle of this ocean of sorrow...it's just something you're going to have to experience yourself, there is just no way for me to describe it in a way that doesn't sound totally fruity.
Voice Acting: Melissa Hutchison is going to win best voice actress on my list this year. I've already decided it. I was simply in awe of her performance as Clementine in this episode. Don't get me wrong, Hutchison has always done a splendid job as Clementine. But never before has an episode of The Walking Dead been more demanding, and Hutchison delivered to all of this episode's demands plus a little extra. But this episode wasn't just demanding for Clementine's voice acting, it was demanding for the voice acting of every surviving character. And literally every character meets these demands. I am insanely proud of the cast of this episode.
Characters: There are only a handful of characters left in this episode, and they all reach new heights. For once, the characters were both compelling and fleshed-out, and some characters take twists that I never saw coming, but these twists didn't seem out of character. They looked like exactly what these characters might do in this situation, but I didn't realize it until it happened. That right there is how you do characters well. You think you know them, and then they show a side of what you already know that you never quite thought about.
Clementine: All throughout this season, we see Clementine faced with decisions harder than she's ever had to make (they never had any effect, whatsoever, but that is beside the point). But in this episode, Clementine is faced with the kinds of decisions that would unquestionably break a lesser mind. But because of the world she is forced to live in, Clementine has no choice but to make these decisions without breaking (she is freaking eleven years old, for crying out loud!), and I for one could see the scars forming. In this episode, we see Clementine faced with the kinds of responsibility that even some adults are afraid of. In this episode, we see Clementine forced to choose what really matters in this completely twisted, dark world. In this episode, we see just how alone Clementine actually is. She is a giant among people, an adult among children, a force of good in a world that doesn't know its meaning anymore. This is the episode where we see this clearly communicated, where we see Clementine just wanting to be a kid again, where we see her just want to be happy for once, where we see her realize that she may never achieve these goals. This is the episode where we see Clementine finally figure out what she wants within the confines of this world. And it is fantastic.
Story: Like I said, the story for this particular episode makes up for the flatness of the other episodes' stories. So much happens within its two hour time frame, and most of the events of the episode made me shiver with fear for little Clementine. The story for the finale does what every other episode should have done. 1) It has variety, 2) It was heartbreaking and occasionally heartwarming as well. I actually did cry at a point 3/4 through the episode, 3) The choices made all the difference in the world, and the end could be entirely different depending on the choices you made, and 4) It felt complete, not just as an episode, but as an end to the season. I walked away from this finale entirely satisfied, though I wished I had made some different choices. A few hours after finishing, I still couldn't get it out of my mind. I loved this finale that much. And that is really what making a good ending is all about: it sits in the consumer's stomach for a long time, making them lose sleep regardless of whether it is sad, happy, or bittersweet.
---------------------                                                          ---------------------

Despite my gripes, the second season isn't all that bad (5). 
You have heard me wail on this season, and you have heard me praise it. So, what do I think of Telltale's, \"The Walking Dead: Season 2?\" In the end, despite all of my many gripes about the journey, the destination was so masterful, so expertly designed, written, and delivered, that I can't help but admit that this season accomplished what it set out to do. It wanted to tell a compelling story, and in the end, it did. It wanted to give us well developed characters, and despite some qualms on that issue, it did. It wanted to tug on our heartstrings, and in the end, it really, really did. It wanted to make us care about Clementine, and, hell, did it even need to try? It didn't need to try, but it did, and as a result, I still care about Clementine more than I have ever cared about any video game character in my entire time as a gamer. In the end, Telltale Games' episodic game series, \"The Walking Dead Season 2,\" accomplished everything it set out to do, but with a few experience-hindering bumps along the way. The finale was an absolute masterpiece, so much so that I am willing to forgive the lesser nature of the prior four episodes. The Walking Dead Season 2 can safely take a place on the shelf for my favorite video game experiences, rough bits and all.
8/10
As always, absolutely fantastic work, Telltale Games, absolutely fantastic work.";
